<h4><a name="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE" id="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE">TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</a></h4>


<p>This translation was undertaken in the belief that there are many
English-speaking people who feel more than a merely superficial
interest in ethical research, but who may not read German with
sufficient ease to make them care to take up the original. The
present Essay is one of the most important contributions to Ethics
since the time of Kant, and, as such, is indispensable to a thorough
knowledge of the subject. Moreover, from whatever point of view it be
regarded,&mdash;whether the reader find, when he closes the book, that his
conviction harmonises with the conclusion reached, or not; it would
be difficult to find any treatise on Moral Science more calculated
to stimulate thought, and lift it out of infantile imitation of some
prescribed pattern. The believer in the Kantian, or any other, basis of
Ethics, could hardly measure the strength or the weakness of his own
position more surely than by comparing it with the Schopenhauerian;
while he who is yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> in search of a foundation will find much in the
following pages to claim his attention.</p>

<p>Those acquainted with the luminous imagery, the subtle irony, the
brusque and penetrating vigour of the German, will doubtless admit that
it is no easy task to reduce Schopenhauer to adequate English prose;
and if this has been attempted by the present writer, no one can be
more conscious than he of the manifold shortcomings discoverable. But
such as it is, the work is heartily offered to all who still follow the
true student's rule, "Gladig wolde he lerne und gladig teche," with
the single hope that it may help, however slightly, to widen their
knowledge, and ripen their judgment.</p>

<p>My friend, R. E. Candy, Esq., I.C.S., has kindly given me information
concerning several Indian names.</p>

</p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>In 1837 the Danish Royal Society of Sciences propounded, as subject
for a prize competition, the question with which this treatise opens;
and Schopenhauer, who was glad to seize the opportunity of becoming
better known, prepared, and sent to Copenhagen, the earliest form of
"The Basis of Morality." In January, 1840, the work was pronounced
unsuccessful, though there was no other candidate. In September of the
same year it was published by the author, with only a few unimportant
additions, but preceded by a long introduction, which, cast in the form
of an exceedingly caustic philippic, is, in its way, a masterpiece. In
1860, (only a month before Schopenhauer's death,) the second edition
was printed with many enlargements and insertions, the short preface,
dated August being one of the last things he wrote.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The reason why the prize was withheld is not far to seek, and need not
detain us. At that time the philosophical atmosphere was saturated with
Hegel, and, to a certain extent, with Fichte; hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> it is easy to
imagine with what ruffled, not to say, scandalised feelings the Academy
must have risen from its perusal of the work. Moreover, putting Hegel
and Fichte out of the question, the position advanced was in 1840 so
new, indeed so paradoxical (as Schopenhauer himself admits); there is
at times such an aggressiveness in the style; the whole essay is so
much more calculated to startle than to conciliate; that we cannot feel
much surprise at the official decision.</p>

<p>In the Judgment published by the Society three reasons are given for
its unfavourable attitude. The second is declared to be not only
dissatisfaction with the mode of discussion (<i>ipsa disserendi forma</i>),
but also inability to see that Schopenhauer proves his case. As the
third is alleged the "unseemly" language employed in connection with
certain "<i>summi philosophi</i>" (Hegel and Fichte). These two objections
are of course in themselves perfectly legitimate, and how far the
Academy was right or wrong may be left for the reader to determine.</p>

<p>But the first reason stated is of a different kind, and affords as neat
an instance of self-stultification proceeding <i>ex cathedra</i> as can well
be found. It is true that the question is worded vaguely enough, but
if it means anything, it asks where the "<i>philosophiae moralis fons
et fundamentum</i>"&mdash;the foundation of moral science&mdash;is to be sought
for, <i>i.e.</i>, where it is to be found. Turning to the Judgment we read:
"He" (Schopenhauer) "has omitted to deal with the essential part of
the question, apparently thinking that he was required to establish
some fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> principle of Ethics": which he was required to do,
unless the Society's Latin is borrowed from <i>Νεϕαλοκοκκυγία.</i> And then
it goes on to declare that he treated as secondary, indeed as an <i>opus
supererogationis,</i> the very thing which the Academy intended should
occupy the first place, namely, the connection between Metaphysics
and Ethics.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But the "<i>metaphysicae et ethicae nexus</i>," so far from
being formulated in the question as the chief point to be considered,
is not even mentioned! The Society thus denies having asked what it
actually did ask, while the discussion, which it asserts was specially
indicated, is not suggested by a single word. Its embarrassment is
sufficiently shown by this unworthy shifting, to enlarge upon which
would here be out of place.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is not intended to offer any criticism either on Schopenhauer's main
position in this essay, or on the various side-issues involved. The
reader is supposed to be accurately acquainted with the fundamentals of
his philosophy, as contained in <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i>,
and is invited to be the critic himself. But perhaps a few remarks on
the structure and general trend of the work may not be amiss.</p>

<p>After preliminary considerations, partly to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> the difficulty of the
subject, partly to clear the ground (Part I.), the treatise opens with
a searching critique of Kant's Ethical Basis, of the Leading Principle
of his system, and of its derived forms. (Part II., Chapters I.-VI.)<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Schopenhauer's conclusion is that the Categorical Imperative is a very
cleverly woven web, yet in reality nothing but the old theological
basis in disguise, the latter being the indispensable, if invisible,
clothes' peg for the former; and that Kant's <i>tour de main</i> of deducing
his Moral Theology from Ethics is like inverting a pyramid. The theory
of Conscience is next discussed (Chapter VII.). The half-supernatural
element which Kant introduced under the highly dramatic form of a court
of justice holding secret session in the breast, is examined, and
eliminated; and Conscience is defined as the knowledge that we have of
ourselves through our acts.</p>

<p>But if, so far, the result obtained is distinctly unfavourable to
Kant, Schopenhauer is glad to agree with him on one point, namely, the
theory of Freedom, to a brief notice of which he now passes (Chapter
VIII.). He points out that the solution of this question is found in
the doctrine of the co-existence of Liberty and Necessity: according to
which the basis of our nature, the so-called Intelligible Character,
that lies outside the forms attaching to phaenomena, namely, Time,
Space, and Causality, is transcendentally free; while the Empirical
Character, together with the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> person, being, as a phaenomenon,
the transient objectivation of the Intelligible Character, under the
laws of the <i>principium individuationis</i>, is strictly determined.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Part II. closes with a sufficiently amusing examination of Fichte
(Chapter IX.). His proper function is shown to be that of a magnifying
glass for Kant. By means of this powerful human lens we can see the
monstrous shapes into which the Kantian pet creations are capable of
developing. Thus we find the Categorical Imperative become a Despotic
Imperative, the "Absolute Ought" grown into a fathomless inscrutable
<i>Εἱμαρμένη</i>, etc.</p>

<p>With Part III. we reach the positive part of the work. Schopenhauer
begins (Chapter I.) by emphasising the necessity of finding a basis
for Ethics that appeals, not to the intellect, but to the intuitive
perception. Such (he says) can never be any artificial formula, which
surely crumbles to powder beneath the rough touch of real life;
rather must it be something springing out of the heart of things, and
therefore lying at the root of man's nature. But is there, he asks
(Chapter II.), after all, such a thing as natural morality? Is anything
good ever done absolutely without an egoistic motive? The conclusion
arrived at is that, although much may be, and has been, at all times,
said in favour of the Sceptical View, and although this view is in
fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> true as regards the greater number of apparently unselfish
acts, yet there can be no doubt that truly moral conduct does occur,
that deeds of justice and loving-kindness are occasionally performed
without the smallest hope of reward, or fear of punishment involved
in their omission. The last paragraph of chis chapter is important
because it puts in the clearest light what, according to Schopenhauer,
is the end of Ethics. Its aim, he says, is <b>not</b> to treat of that
which people <b>ought to do</b> (for "ought" has no place except in
theological Morals, whether explicit, or implicit); but "to point out
all the varied moral lines of human conduct; to explain them; and to
trace them to their ultimate source." This definition, which assigns no
educative function to Ethics, strictly agrees with the doctrine of the
unchangeableness of character. (<i>V</i>. Chapter IX. of this Part.)</p>

<p>Our philosopher then proceeds to show (Chapter III.) that there are two
fundamental "antimoral" incentives in man's nature: Egoism and Malice.
Be it, however, here remarked that a still simpler classification would
reduce these two to one. Malice may well be regarded as nothing but
Egoism carried to its extreme, developed to gigantic proportions. It is
a distinct source of gratification to certain natures to witness the
suffering of another; because a diminution of the latter's capacity
for action, whether effected by itself, or not, is regarded by an ego
of this kind as an increase of its own power to do as it likes,&mdash;as an
enhancement of its own glorification.</p>

<p>In Chapter IV. the ultimate test of truly moral conduct is explained to
be the absence of all egoistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> motivation; and in Chapters V.-VII.,
by a process of careful reasoning, every human act is traced to one
of three original springs, namely, (1) Egoism, (2) Malice, and (3)
Compassion; or to a combination of (1) and (3), or (1) and (2).<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Of
these the third is shown to be the only counter-motive to the first
and second, and in fact the sole source of the two cardinal virtues,
justice and loving-kindness, which are explained as the manifestation
of Compassion in a lower, and a higher, degree, respectively. In
the course of the demonstration the question as to how far a lie is
legitimate comes incidentally under discussion; as also the theory of
Duty; duties being defined as "actions, the simple omission of which
constitutes a wrong." (Cf. Part II., Chapter III.)</p>

<p>The position now reached, namely, that Compassion is the one and only
fount of true morality, because it is the sole non-egoistic source of
action, is (says Schopenhauer) a strange paradox; hence the testimony
of experience and of universal human sentiment is appealed to, in
confirmation of it, under nine different considerations (Chapter
VIII.). They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) An imaginary case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Cruelty, which means the maximum deficiency in Compassion, is the
mark of the deepest moral depravity. Therefore the real moral incentive
must be Compassion.</p>

<p>(3) Compassion is the only thoroughly effective spring of moral conduct.</p>

<p>(4) Limitless Compassion for all living things is the surest and most
certain token of a really good man.</p>

<p>(5) The evidence of separate matters of detail.</p>

<p>(6) Compassion is more easily discerned in its higher power; it is more
obviously the root of loving-kindness than of justice.</p>

<p>(7) Compassion does not stop short with men; it includes all living
beings.</p>

<p>(8) Considered simply from the empirical point of view, Compassion is
the best possible antidote to Egoism, no less than the most soothing
balsam for the world's inevitable suffering.</p>

<p>(9) Rousseau's testimony is quoted, as well as passages from the
Paṅća-tantra, Pausanias, Lucian, Stobaeus, and Lessing; and reference
is made to Chinese Ethics and Hindu customs.</p>

<p>Part III. closes (Chapter IX.) with an inquiry into the Ethical
Difference of Character. The theory that this difference is innate
and immutable is supported by numerous extracts from various writers
of all periods, and illustrated in many ways. But all the evidence
accumulated hardly amounts to more than so many hints and indications,
and the matter (says Schopenhauer) was only satisfactorily explained
by Kant's doctrine of the Intelligible and Empirical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> Character. (Cf.
Part II., Chapter VIII.) According to this, the ethical difference
between man and man is an original and ultimate datum, caused by
the transcendentally free act of the Intelligible Character, that
is, the Will, as Thing in itself, outside phaenomena; the Empirical
Character being, so to say, the reflection of the Intelligible,
mirrored through the functions of our perceptive faculty, namely,
Time, Space, and Causality. Hence the former, while manifested in
plurality and difference of acts, yet necessarily always wears the same
unchangeable features, inasmuch as it is but the appearance-form of
the unity behind. If the reader asks why "the essential constitution
of the Thing in itself underlying the phaenomenon" is so enormously
different in different individuals, it can only be said that our
intellect, conditioned, as it is, by the laws of Causality, Space, and
Time, has no power to deal with noumena, its range being limited to
phaenomena; and that therefore this question is one of those which have
no conceivable answer. (Cf. <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i>, vol.
ii., chap. 50., Epiphilosophie.)<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span></p>

<p>The discussion now terminated points to the conclusion that
nine-tenths, or perhaps nineteen-twentieths, of what we do is, more
or less, due to Egoism, conscious or unconscious; while acts of real
morality, that is, of unselfish justice and pure loving-kindness
(admitting that they occur) are to be attributed to Compassion, that
is, the sense of <b>suffering with</b> another. Nor is the principle of
Altruism new. It is as old as man himself. All the rare and sensitive
natures in the world have given utterance to it, each in his own way.
Like a golden thread it runs from the earliest Indian literature to
George Eliot, to Tolstoï; and every day, for unnumbered ages, "from
youth to eld, from sire to son," in lowly dwellings and in princes'
palaces, it has been unawares translated into action.</p>

<p>And if we may forecast the future from the past, it would appear that
in all the stormy seas yet to be traversed by the human race, before
its little day is spent, Compassion will ever be the surest guide to
better things; and that the light of knowledge illuminating the path,
whereby the world may become relatively happier, will always vary
directly as man's susceptibility to its promptings: for "<b>Durch
Mitleid wissend</b>" is not truer of Parsifal than of all other
saviours.</p>

<p>In the fourth Part of the treatise Schopenhauer attempts the
metaphysical explanation of Compassion, which for those, who still
think that Metaphysics is something more than a pseudo-science of the
past&mdash;like Alchemy or Astrology&mdash;will have special interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be observed (as is pointed out in our author's Preface
to the first edition) that the line of thought followed does not
belong to any particular metaphysical school, but to many; being in
fact a principle at the root of the oldest systems in the world, and
traceable in one form or another down to Kant. As in the dawn of
history it was our own Aryan forefathers, who divined with subtle
intuition the ideality of Time and Space; so in the fulness of the
ages it was reserved for another Aryan of Scotch descent to formulate
the same in exact language. Now, by the vast majority of men the
ideality of the <i>principium individuationis</i> is undoubtedly either
not consciously realised at all, or else but dimly perceived under
the form of allegories and mythologies. Yet, if this theory be true,
if individuation be only a phaenomenon depending on the subjectivity
of Time and Space, then Compassion, and its external expression, the
<i>ἀγάπη</i> that is greater than Faith and Hope, receive their final
explanation. And every <i>εὐθανασία</i>; every word that vibrates in
harmony with the inspired rhapsody of 1 Corinthians xiii.; every act
of genuine justice, or of true loving-kindness, done by man to man, as
well as the uplifting emotion which stirs our hearts at the sight of
such conduct:&mdash;all these things become fraught with a new and luminous
significance: the secret writing is interpreted, its deepest meaning
disclosed.</p>

<p>Moreover, the "thou shalt," and the "thou shalt not," no less of the
various theologies than of the Categorical Imperative, may from this
point of view be accounted for, on the ground of the <b>identity</b>
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> man, so far as he is <b>noumenal</b>, with the transcendental
Reality behind phaenomena. The crude threats of punishment and promises
of reward, the stern Moral Law, poised in mid air,&mdash;these hypotheses,
and all their varieties (whose function is in reality nothing
else but to check Egoism), are seen to be due to the intellect's
imperfect comprehension of, or rather, its vague groping after, the
transcendental unity of life, however individualised and differentiated
as a phaenomenon in Time and Space.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It thus becomes apparent
that the position developed by Schopenhauer in the third and fourth
parts of the Essay is not so much destructive, as explanatory, of
the usual theories, which, if once the former be fully grasped, lose
themselves in it as stars and moon in the light of day. They are at
once interpreted, and shown to be no longer of importance. Similarly,
all the religions of the world, "which are the Metaphysics of the
people," find their <i>raison d'être</i> in the same doctrine. The theory
of an <b>external</b> <i>δημιουργὸς</i> takes its place as the natural mode

we could quicken the noble edifice of 'Love, Faith, and Hope,' with a

laws of Space and Time, which form the sole basis of our perceptive
capacity! In that case all anxious inquiries as to a 'Where' and 'When'
of the 'other world' would be understood to be only answerable by a
blissful smile. For, if there is a solution to these questions, which
seem of such boundless importance, our philosopher has given it with
incomparable precision and beauty in the following sentence, which, to
a certain extent, is only a corollary to the definition of the ideality
of Time and Space: 'Peace, Rest, and Bliss dwell only there where there
is <b>no where, and no when</b>.'" (<i>V</i>. Schopenhauer: <i>Parerga and

<hr class="r5" />

<p>The question advanced by the Royal Society, together with the
considerations leading up to it, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Quum primitiva,', moralitatis idea, sive de summa lege morali

<p><i><b>Philosophiae moralis fons et fundamentum</b> utrum in idea

<p>(The original idea of morality, or the leading conception of the
supreme moral law, occurs by a necessity which seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> peculiar to the
subject, but which is by no means a logical one, both in that science,
whose object it is to set forth the knowledge of what is moral, and
also in real life, where it shows itself partly in the judgment passed
by conscience on our own actions, partly in our moral estimation of the
actions of others; moreover, most of the chief conceptions in Ethics,
springing as they do out of that idea, and inseparable from it (as,
for instance, the conception of duty, and the ascription of praise
or blame) assert themselves with the same necessity, and under the
same conditions. In view of these facts and because it appears highly
desirable, considering the trend of philosophic investigation in our
time, to submit this matter to further scrutiny; the Society desires
that the following question be carefully considered and discussed:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Is the fountain and basis of Morals to be sought for</b> in an idea
of morality which lies directly in the consciousness (or conscience),
and in the analysis of the other leading ethical conceptions which
arise from it? or is it to be found an some other source of knowledge?)</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h4>

<h3>THE PROBLEM.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>"Why do philosophers differ so widely as to the first principles of
Morals, but agree respecting the conclusions and duties which they
deduce from those principles?"</p>

<p>This is the question which was set as subject for a prize essay by
the Royal Society of Holland at Harlem, 1810, and solved by J. C. F.
Meister; and in comparison with the task before us, the inquiry
presented no extraordinary difficulty. For:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The present question of the Royal Society has to do with nothing
less important than the objectively true basis of morals, and
consequently of morality. It is an Academy, be it observed, which
invites this inquiry; and hence, from its position, it has no practical
purpose in view; it asks for no discourse inculcating the exercise of
uprightness and virtue, with arguments based on evidence, of which
the plausibility is dwelt on, and the sophistry evaded, as is done
in popular manuals. Rather, as its aim is not practical, but only
theoretical, it desires nothing but the purely philosophical, that
is, the objective, undisguised, and naked exposition of the ultimate
basis of all good moral conduct, independent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> every positive law, of
every improved assumption, and hence free from all groundwork, whether
metaphysical or mythical. This, however, is a problem whose bristling
difficulties are attested by the circumstance that all philosophers in
every age and land have blunted their wits on it, and still more by
the fact that all gods, oriental and occidental, actually derive their
existence therefrom. Should therefore this opportunity serve to solve
it, assuredly the Royal Society will not have expended its money amiss.</p>

<p>(2) Apart from this, a peculiar disadvantage will be found to attach
to any theoretical examination of the basis of morals, because such
an investigation is suspiciously like an attempt to undermine, and
occasion the collapse of, the structure itself. The fact is, that in
this matter we are apt to so closely associate practical aims with
theory, that the well-meant zeal of the former is with difficulty
restrained from ill-timed intervention. Nor is it within the power
of every one to clearly dissociate the purely theoretical search for
objective truth, purged of all interest, even of that of morality as
practised, from a shameless attack on the heart's sacred convictions.
Therefore he, who here puts his hand to the plough, must, for his
encouragement, ever bear in mind that from the doings and affairs of
the populace, from the turmoil and bustle of the market-place, nothing
is further removed than the quiet retreat and sanctuary of the Academy,
where no noise of the world may enter, and where the only god raised on
a pedestal is Truth, in solitary, naked sublimity.</p>

<p>The conclusion from these two premises is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> I must be allowed
complete freedom of speech, as well as the right of questioning
everything; and furthermore, that if I succeed in really contributing
something, however small, to this subject, then that contribution will
be of no little importance.</p>

<p>But there are still other difficulties obstructing my path. The
Royal Society asks for a short monograph setting forth the basis of
Ethics entirely by itself; which means to say, independent of its
connection with the general system, <i>i.e.</i>, the actual metaphysics of
any philosophy. Such a demand must not only render the accomplishment
of the task more difficult, but necessarily make it imperfect. Long
ago Christian Wolff, in his <i>Philosophia Practica</i> (P. II., § 28)
observed: "<i>Tenebrae in philosophia practica non dispelluntur, nisi
luce metaphysica effulgente</i>" (Darkness in practical philosophy is
only dispersed, when the light of metaphysics shines on it;) and Kant
in the Preface to his <i>Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten</i> remarks:
"Metaphysics must precede, and is in every case indispensable to,
moral philosophy." For, just as every religion on earth, so far as
it prescribes morality, does not leave the latter to rest on itself,
but backs it by a body of dogmas (the chief end of which is precisely
to be the prop of the moral sense); so with philosophy, the ethical
basis, whatever it be, must itself attach to, and find its support in,
one system of metaphysics or another, that is to say, in a presupposed
explanation of the world, and of existence in general. This is so,
because the ultimate and true conclusion concerning the essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
nature of the Universe must necessarily be closely connected with that
touching the ethical significance of human action; and because, in any
case, that which is presented as the foundation of morality, if it is
not to be merely an abstract formula, floating in the clouds, and out
of contact with the real world, must be some fact or other discoverable
either in the objective kosmos, or else in man's consciousness; but,
as such, it can itself be only a phaenomenon; and consequently, like
all other phaenomena, it requires a further explanation; and this
explanation is supplied by Metaphysics. Philosophy indeed is such a
connected whole that it is impossible to exhaustively discuss any one
part without all the others being involved. Thus Plato says quite
correctly: <i>ψυχῆs oὗν ϕύσιν ἀξίως λόγου κατανοῆσαι oἴει δυνατὸν εἷναι,
ἄνευ τῆς τοῡ ὅλον ϕυσεως</i>; (Phaedr., p. 371, Ed. Bip.) (Do you think
then it is possible to understand at all adequately the nature of
the soul, without at the same time understanding the nature of the
Whole, <i>i.e.</i>, the totality of things?) The metaphysics of nature, the
metaphysics of morals, and the metaphysics of the beautiful mutually
presuppose each other, and only when taken as connected together do
they complete the explanation of things as they really are, and of
existence in general. So that whoever should exactly trace one of
these three to its ultimate origin, would be found to have necessarily
brought the others into his solution of the problem; just as an
absolutely clear and exhaustive understanding of any single thing in
the world would imply a perfect comprehension of everything else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Now if we were to start from a given system of metaphysics, which is
assumed to be true, we should reach synthetically a basis of morals,
and this basis, being, so to say, built up from below, would provide
the resulting ethical structure with a sure foundation. But in the
present case, since the terms of the question enforce the separation
of ethics from all metaphysics, there remains nothing but the analytic
method, which proceeds from facts either of external experience, or of
consciousness. It is true that thus the ultimate origin of the latter
may be traced back to the human spirit, a source which then, however,
must be taken as a fundamental fact, a primary phaenomenon, underivable
from anything else, with the result that the whole explanation remains
simply a psychological one. At best its connection with any general
metaphysical standpoint can only be described as accessory. On the
other hand, the fundamental datum, the primary phaenomenon of Ethics,
so found in man's nature, could itself in its turn be accounted for
and explained, if we might first treat of metaphysics, and then by
the synthetic method deduce Ethics from it. This would mean, however,
nothing less than the construction of a complete system, of philosophy,
whereby the limits of the given question would be far exceeded. I
am, therefore, compelled to answer it within the lines which its own
isolated narrowness has laid down.</p>

<p>And lastly, there is the following consideration. The basis on which
it is here intended to place Ethics will prove to be a very small
one; and the consequence is that of the many lawful, approvable, and
praiseworthy actions of mankind, only the minority will be found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
spring from purely moral motives, while the majority will have to be
attributed to other sources. This gives less satisfaction, has not such
a specious glitter as, let us say, a Categorical Imperative, which
always stands ready for commands, only that itself in its turn may
command what ought to be done, and what ought to be left undone;<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> not
to mention other foundations that are entirely material.</p>

<p>I can only, therefore, remind the reader of the saying in Ecclesiastes
(iv. 6): "Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full
with travail and vexation of spirit." In all knowledge the genuine,
proof-resisting, indestructible coefficient is never large; just as in
the earth's metallic strata a hundredweight of stone hides but a few
ounces of gold. But whether others will prefer&mdash;as I do&mdash;the assured
to the bulky possession, the small quantity of gold which remains in
the crucible to the big lump of matter that was brought along with
it; or whether I shall rather be charged with having removed from
Ethics its basis, instead of providing one, in so far as I prove that
the lawful and commendable actions of mankind often do not contain a
particle of pure moral worth, and in most cases only a very little,
resting, as they do, otherwise on motives, the sufficiency of which
must ultimately be referred to the egoism of the doer; all this I must
leave undecided; and I do so, not without anxiety, nay, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> with
resignation, because I have long since been of the same mind as Johann
Georg von Zimmermann, when he said: "Rest assured until your dying day,
that nothing in the world is so rare as a good judge." (<i>Ueber die
Einsamkeit</i>; Pt. I., Ch. iii., p. 93.)</p>

<p>For all true and voluntary righteousness, for all loving-kindness, for
all nobleness, wherever these qualities may be found, my theory can
only point to a very small foundation; whereas my opponents confidently
construct broad bases for Morals, which are made strong enough for
every possible burden, and are at the same time thrust upon every
doubter's conscience, accompanied with a threatening side-glance at his
own morality. As contrasted with these, my own position is indeed in
sore and sorry plight. It is like that of Cordelia before King Lear,
with her weakly worded assurance of dutiful affection, compared with
the effusive protestations of her more eloquent sisters. So that there
seems to be need of a cordial that may be furnished by some maxim taken
from intellectual hunting grounds, such as, <i>Magna est vis veritatis,
et praevalebit</i>. (Great is the strength of truth, and it will prevail.)
But to a man who has lived and laboured even this fails to give much
encouragement. Meanwhile, I will for once make the venture with truth
on my side; and what opposes me will at the same time oppose truth.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<h3>GENERAL RETROSPECT.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>For the people morality comes through, and is founded on, theology, as
the express will of God. On the other hand, we see philosophers, with
few exceptions, taking special pains to entirely exclude this kind of
foundation; indeed, so they may but avoid it, they prefer even to find
a refuge in sophistry. Whence comes this antithesis? Assuredly no more
efficient basis for Ethics can be imagined than the theological; for
who would be so bold as to oppose the will of the Almighty and the
Omniscient? Unquestionably, no one; if only this will were proclaimed
in an authentic, official manner (if one may say so), whereby no
possible room for doubt could be left. This, however, is precisely the
condition which does not admit of being realised. It is rather the
inverse process which is attempted. The law declared to be the will of
God men try to accredit as such, by demonstrating its agreement with
our own independent, and hence, natural moral views, and an appeal
is consequently made to these as being more direct and certain. But
this is not all. We perceive that an action performed solely through
threat of punishment and promise of reward would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> be moral much more
in appearance than in reality; since, after all, it would have its
root in Egoism, and in the last resort the scale would be turned by
the greater or less amount of credulity evinced in each case. Now it
was none other than Kant who destroyed the foundations of Speculative
Theology, which up to his time were accounted unshakable. Speculative
Theology had hitherto sustained Ethics, and in order to procure for the
former an existence of some sort, if only an imaginary one, his wish
was to proceed inversely, and make Ethics sustain Speculative Theology.
So that it is now more than ever impossible to think of basing Ethics
on Theology; for no one knows any longer which of the two is to be the
supporter, and which the supported, and the consequence is a <i>circulus
vitiosus</i>.</p>

<p>It is precisely through the influence of Kant's philosophy; through the
contemporaneous effect of the unparalleled progress made in all the
natural sciences, with regard to which every past age in comparison
with our own appears childish; and lastly, through the knowledge of
Sanskrit literature, and of those most ancient and widest spread
faiths, Brahmanism and Buddhism, which, as far as time and space go,
are the most important religions systems of mankind, and, as a matter
of fact, are the original native religions of our own race, now well
known to be of Asiatic descent&mdash;our race, to which in its new strange
home they once more send a message across the centuries;&mdash;it is because
of all this, I say, that the fundamental philosophical convictions of
learned Europe have in the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> of the last fifty years undergone a
revolution, which perhaps many only reluctantly admit, but which cannot
be denied. The result of this change is that the old supports of Ethics
have been shown to be rotten, while the assurance remains that Ethics
itself can never collapse; whence the conviction arises that for it
there must exist a groundwork different from any hitherto provided,
and adaptable to the advanced views of the age. The need of such is
making itself felt more and more, and in it we undoubtedly find the
reason that has induced the Royal Society to make the present important
question the subject of a prize essay.</p>

<p>In every age much good morality has been preached; but the explanation
of its <i>raison d'être</i> has always been encompassed with difficulties.
On the whole we discern an endeavour to get at some objective truth,
from which the ethical injunctions could-be logically deduced; and
it has been sought for both in the nature of things, and in the
nature of man; but in vain. The result was always the same. The will
of each human unit was found to gravitate solely towards its own
individual welfare, the idea of which in its entirety is designated
by the term "blissfulness" (<i>Glückseligkeit</i>); and this striving
after self-satisfaction leads mankind by a path very, different to
the one morality would fain point out. The endeavour was next made
now to identify "blissfulness" with virtue, now to represent it as
virtue's consequence and effect. Both attempts have always failed; and
this for no want of sophistry. Then recourse was had to artificial
formulas, purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> objective and abstract, as well <i>a posteriori</i> as
<i>a priori</i>, from which correct ethical conduct undoubtedly admitted
of being deduced. But there was nothing found in man's nature to
afford these a footing, whereby they might have availed to guide the
strivings of his volition, in face of its egoistic tendency. It appears
to me superfluous to verify all this by describing and criticising
every hitherto existing foundation of morality; not only because I
share Augustine's opinion, <i>non est pro magno habendum quid homines
senserint, sed quae sit rei veritas</i> (It is the truth about a thing,
not men's opinions thereon, that is of importance); but also because it
would be like <i>γλαύκας εἰς 'Aθήνας κομίζειν</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, carrying coals to
Newcastle); for previous attempts to give a foundation to Ethics are
sufficiently well-known to the Royal Society, and the very question
proposed shows that it is also convinced of their inadequateness.
Any reader less well-informed will find a careful, if not complete,
presentment of the attempts hitherto made, in Garve's <i>Uebersicht der
vornehmsten Principien der Sittenlehre</i>, and again, in Stäudlin's
<i>Geschichte der Moralphilosophie.</i> It is of course very disheartening
to reflect that Ethics, which so directly concerns life, has met with
the same unhappy fate as the abstruse science of Metaphysics, and that
its first principle, though perpetually sought for ever since the time
of Socrates, has still to be found. Moreover, we must remember that
in Ethics, much more than in any other science, what is essential
is contained in its fundamental propositions; the deductions are so
simple that they come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> of themselves. For all are capable of drawing
a conclusion, but few of judging. And this is exactly the reason why
lengthy text-books and dissertations on Morals are as superfluous as
they are tedious. Meantime, if I may postulate an acquaintance with all
the former foundations of Ethics, my task will be lightened. Whoever
observes how ancient as well as modern philosophers (the Church creed
sufficed for the middle ages) have had recourse to the most diverse
and extraordinary arguments, in order to provide for the generally
recognised requirements of morality a basis capable of proof, and how
notwithstanding they admittedly failed; he will be able to measure the
difficulty of the problem, and estimate my contribution accordingly.
And he who has learned to know that none of the roads hitherto struck
on lead to the goal, will be the more willing to tread with me a very
different path from these&mdash;a path which up to now either has not been
noticed, or else has been passed over with contempt; perhaps because
it was the most natural one.<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As a matter of fact my solution of the
question will remind many of Columbus' egg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>It is solely to the latest attempt at giving, a basis to Ethics&mdash;I mean
the Kantian&mdash;that a critical examination will be devoted. I shall make
it all the more exhaustive, partly because the great ethical reform of
Kant gave to this science a foundation having a real superiority to
previous ones and partly because it still remains the last important
pronouncement in this domain; for which reason it has obtained general
acceptance up to the present day, and is universally taught, although
differently garnished by certain changes in the demonstration and in
the terminology. It is the ethical system of the last sixty years,
which must be removed ere we enter on another path. Furthermore, my
criticism of the Kantian basis will give me occasion to examine and
discuss most of the fundamental conceptions of Ethics, and the outcome
of this investigation I shall later on be able to postulate. Besides,
inasmuch as opposites illustrate each other, it is exactly this course
which will be the best preparation and guide, indeed the direct way, to
my own position, which in its essential points is diametrically opposed
to Kant's. It would therefore be a very perverse beginning to skip
the following criticism, and turn at once to the positive part of my
exposition, which then would remain only half intelligible.</p>

<p>In any case the time has assuredly arrived for once to cite Ethics
before the bar of a searching scrutiny. During more than half a century
it has been lying comfortably on the restful cushion which Kant
arranged for it&mdash;the cushion of the Categorical Imperative of Practical
Reason. In our day this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> Imperative is mostly introduced to us under
a name which, being smoother and less ostentatious, has obtained more
currency. It is called "the Moral Law"; and thus entitled, with a
passing bow to reason and experience, it slips through unobserved into
the house. Once inside, there is no end to its orders and commands; nor
can it ever afterwards be brought to account. It was proper, indeed
inevitable, that Kant, as the inventor of the thing, should remain
satisfied with his creation, particularly as he shelved by its means
errors still more glaring. But to be obliged to look on and see asses
disporting themselves on the comfortable cushion which he prepared, and
which since his time has been more and more trampled on and flattened
out&mdash;this truly is hard. I allude to the daily hackney compilers, who,
with the ready confidence born of stupidity, imagine that they have
given a foundation to Ethics, if they do but appeal to that "Moral
Law" which Is alleged to be inherent in our reason; and then they
complacently weave upon this such a confused and wide-reaching tissue
of phrases that they succeed in rendering unintelligible the clearest
and simplest relations of life: and all this, without ever once
seriously asking themselves whether in point of fact there really does
exist such a "Moral Law," as a convenient code of morality, graven in
our heads or hearts.</p>

<p>Hence I admit the especial pleasure I feel in proceeding to remove
from Ethics its broad cushion of repose, and I unreservedly
declare my intention of proving that Kant's Practical Reason and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Categorical Imperative are completely unwarrantable, baseless,
and fabricated assumptions; and I shall further show that Kant's
whole system, like those of his predecessors, is in want of a solid
foundation. Consequently Ethics will again be consigned to its
former entirely helpless condition, there to remain, until I come to
demonstrate the true moral principle of human nature&mdash;a principle
which is incontestably efficient, and has its root in our very
being. The latter, however, has no such broad basis to offer as the
above-mentioned cushion; so that, doubtless, those who are accustomed
to take things easily, will not abandon their comfortable old seat,
before they are thoroughly aware how deeply the ground on which it
stands is undermined.</p>

<h3>CRITIQUE OF KANT'S BASIS OF ETHICS.</h3>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>




<h4><a name="CHAPTER_Ib" id="CHAPTER_Ib">CHAPTER I.</a></h4>

<h3>PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>It is Kant's great service to moral science that he purified it of all
Eudaemonism. With the ancients, Ethics was a doctrine of Eudaemonism;
with the moderns for the most part it has been a doctrine of salvation.
The former wished to prove that virtue and happiness are identical;
but this was like having two figures which never coincide with each
other, no matter how they may be placed. The latter have endeavoured
to connect the two, not by the principle of identity, but by that of
causation, thus making happiness the result of virtue; but to do this,
they were obliged to have recourse to sophisms, or else to assume the
existence of a world beyond any possible perception of the senses.</p>

<p>Among the ancients Plato alone forms an exception: his system is not
eudaemonistic; it is mystic, instead. Even the Ethics of the Cynics
and Stoics is nothing but a special form of Eudaemonism, to prove
which, there is no lack of evidence and testimony, but the nature of my
present task forbids the space.<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The ancients, then, equally with the moderns, Plato being the single
exception, agree in making virtue only a means to an end. Indeed,
strictly speaking, even Kant banished Eudaemonism from Ethics more in
appearance than in reality, for between virtue and happiness he still
leaves a certain mysterious connection; &mdash;there is an obscure and
difficult passage in his doctrine of the Highest Good, where they occur
together; while it is a patent fact that the course of; virtue runs
entirely counter to that of happiness. But, passing over this, we may
say that with Kant the ethical principle appears as something quite
independent of experience and its teaching; it is transcendental, or
metaphysical. He recognises that human conduct possesses a significance
that oversteps all possibility of experience, and is therefore actually
the bridge leading to that which he calls the "intelligible"<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> world,
the <i>mundus noumenôn</i>, the world of Things in themselves.</p>

<p>The fame, which the Kantian Ethics has won, is due not only to this
higher level, which it reached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> but also to the moral purity and
loftiness of its conclusions. It is by the latter that most people have
been attracted, without paying much attention to the foundation, which
is propounded in a very complex, abstract and artificial form; and Kant
himself required all his powers of acumen and synthesis to give it an
appearance of solidity. Fortunately, he separated his Ethics from the
exposition of its basis, devoting to the latter a special work entitled
the <i>Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten</i>, the theme of which will
be found to be precisely the same as that of our prize essay. For on
page xiii of the preface he says: "The present treatise is nothing
else but an attempt to find out and establish the supreme principle of
morality. This is an investigation, whose scope is complete in itself,
and which should be kept apart from all other moral researches.". It
is in this book that we find the basis, that is to say, the essentials
of his Ethics set forth with an acute penetration and systematic
conciseness, as in no other of his writings. It has, moreover, the
great advantage of being the first of Kant's moral works, appearing,<a name="FNanchor_3_14" id="FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_14" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
as it did, only four years later than the <i>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</i>,
and consequently it dates from the period when, although he was
sixty-one, the detrimental effect of old age on his intellect was not
yet perceptible. On the other hand, this is distinctly traceable in
the <i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i>, which was published in 1788, or
one year later than the unhappy remodelling of the <i>Kritik der Reinen
Vernunft</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> in the second edition, whereby the latter, his immortal
master-piece, was obviously marred. An analysis of this question is
to be found in the preface to the new edition by Rosenkranz,<a name="FNanchor_4_15" id="FNanchor_4_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_15" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> from
which my own investigation makes it impossible for me to dissent. The
<i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i> contains in its essentials the same
material as the above-mentioned&mdash;<i>Grundlegung</i>; only the latter has
a more concise and rigorous form, while in the former the subject is
handled with greater prolixity, interspersed with digressions and even
padded with some pieces of moral rhetoric, to heighten the impression.
When Kant wrote it, he had at last, and late in life, become deservedly
famous; hence, being certain of boundless attention, he allowed greater
play to the garrulity of old age.</p>

<p>But the <i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i> contains two sections
which are peculiar to itself. First: the exposition of the relation
between Freedom and Necessity (pp. 169-179 of the fourth edition,
and pp. 223-231 in Rosenkranz). This passage is above all praise,
and undoubtedly was framed earlier in his life, as it is entirely
in harmony with his treatment of the same subject in the <i>Kritik
der Reinen Vernunft</i> (pp. 560-586; Rosenkranz, p. 438, sqq.). And
secondly: the <i>Moraltheologie</i>, which will more and more come to be
recognised as the real object Kant had in view. In his <i>Metaphysische
Anfangsgründe der Tugendlehre</i> this <i>pendant</i> to the deplorable
<i>Rechtslehre</i>, written in 1797, the debility of old age is at length
fully pre-ponderant. For all these reasons the present criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> will
mainly deal with the treatise first mentioned, <i>viz.,</i> the <i>Grundlegung
zur Metaphysik der Sitten</i>, and the reader will please understand
that all the page numbers given by themselves refer to it. Both the
other works will only be considered as accessory and secondary. For a
proper comprehension of the present criticism, which, in probing the
Kantian Ethics to its depths, bears directly and principally on this
<i>Grundlegung</i>, it is very desirable that the latter be carefully read
through again, so that the mind may have a perfectly clear and fresh
presentment of what it contains. It is but a matter of 128 and xiv
pages (in Rosenkranz only 100 pages altogether). I shall quote from
the third edition of 1792, adding the page number of the new complete
publication by Rosenkranz, with an R. prefixed.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IIb" id="CHAPTER_IIb">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<h3>ON THE IMPERATIVE FORM OF THE KANTIAN ETHICS.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Kant's <i>πρῶτον ψεῡδος</i> (first false step) lies in his conception of
Ethics itself, and this is found very clearly expressed on page 62
(R., p. 54): "In a system of practical philosophy we are not concerned
with adducing reasons for that which takes place, but with formulating
laws regarding that which <b>ought to take place, even if it never
does take place</b>." This is at once a distinct <i>petitio principii.</i>
Who tells you that there are laws to which our conduct <b>ought</b> to
be subject? Who tells you that that <b>ought to take place, which in
fact never does take place</b>? What justification have you for making
this assumption at the outset, and consequently for forcing upon us,
as the only possible one, a system of Ethics couched in the imperative
terms of legislation? I say, in contradistinction to Kant, that the
student of Ethics, and no less the philosopher in general, must content
himself with explaining and interpreting that which is given, in
other words, that which really is, or takes place, so as to obtain an
<b>understanding</b> of it, and I maintain furthermore that there is
plenty to do in this direction, much more than has hitherto been done,
after the lapse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> of thousands of years. Following the above <i>petitio
principii</i>, Kant straightway, without any previous investigation,
assumes in the preface (which is entirely devoted to the subject),
that purely moral laws exist; and this assumption remains thenceforth
undisturbed, and forms the very foundation of his whole system. We,
however, prefer first of all to examine the conception denoted by the
word "law." The true and original meaning of the term is limited to
law as between citizens; it is the <i>lex</i>, <i>νόμος</i>, of the Romans and
Greeks, a human institution, and depending on human volition. It has
a secondary, derived, figurative, metaphorical meaning, when applied
to Nature, whose operations, partly known <i>a priori</i>, partly learnt
by experience, and which are always constant, we call natural laws.
Only a very small portion of these natural laws can be discerned <i>a
priori</i>, and with admirable acuteness, Kant set them apart, and classed
them under the name "Metaphysics of Nature." There is also undoubtedly
a law for the human will, in so far as man belongs to Nature; and
this law is strictly provable, admits of no exception, is inviolable,
and immovable as the mountains, and does not, like the Categorical
Imperative, imply a quasi-necessity, but rather a complete and absolute
one. It is the law of motivation, a form of the law of causation; in
other words, it is the causation which is brought about by the medium
of the understanding. It is the sole demonstrable law to which the
human will <b>as such</b> is subject. It means that every action can
only take place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> consequence of a sufficient motive. Like causality
in general, it is a natural law. On the other hand, moral laws, apart
from human institution, state ordinance, or religious doctrine, cannot
rightly be assumed as existing without proof. Kant, therefore, by
taking such laws for granted, is guilty of a <i>petitio principii</i>, which
is all the bolder, in that he at once adds (page vi of the preface)
that a moral law ought to imply "<b>absolute necessity</b>." But
"absolute necessity" is everywhere characterised by an inevitable chain
of consequence; how, then, can such a conception be attached to these
alleged moral laws (as an instance of which he adduces "thou shalt
not lie"<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>)? Every one knows, and he himself admits, that no such
consecution for the most part takes place; the reverse, indeed, is the
rule.</p>

<p>In scientific Ethics before we admit as controlling the will other laws
besides that of motivation-laws which are original and independent of
all human ordinance&mdash;we must first prove and deduce their existence;
that is, provided in things ethical we are concerned not merely with
recommending honesty, but with practising it. Until that proof be
furnished, I shall recognise only one source to which is traceable
the importation into Ethics of the conception <b>Law, Precept,
Obligation</b>. It is one which is foreign to philosophy. I mean the
Mosaic Decalogue. Indeed the spelling "<b>du sollt</b>"<a name="FNanchor_2_17" id="FNanchor_2_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_17" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
above instance of a moral law, the first put forward by Kant, naïvely
betrays this origin. A conception, however, which can\ point to no
other source than this, has no right, without undergoing further
scrutiny, thus to force its way into philosophical Ethics. It will
be rejected, until introduced by duly accredited proof. Thus on the
threshold of the subject Kant makes his first <i>petitio principii</i>, and
that no small one.</p>

<p>Our philosopher, then, by begging the question in his preface, simply
assumes the conception of <b>Moral Law</b> as given and existing
beyond all doubt; and he treats the closely related conception of Duty
(page 8, R., p. 16) exactly in the same way. Without subjecting it
to any further test, he admits it forthwith as a proper appurtenance
of Ethics. But here, again, I am compelled to enter a protest. This
conception, equally with the kindred notions of <b>Law, Command,
Obligation</b>, etc., taken thus unconditionally, has its source in
theological morals, and it will remain a stranger to philosophical
morals, so long as it fails to furnish sufficient credentials drawn
either from man's nature, or from the objective world. Till then, I
can only recognise the Decalogue as the origin of all these connected
conceptions. Since the rise of Christianity there is no doubt that
philosophical has been unconsciously moulded by theological ethics.
And since the latter is essentially dictatorial, the former appears in
the shape of precepts and inculcation of Duty, in all innocence, and
without any suspicion that first an ulterior sanction is needful for
this <i>rôle</i>; rather does she suppose it to be her proper and natural
form. It is true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> all peoples, ages, and creeds, and indeed all
philosophers (with the exception of the materialists proper) have
undeniably recognised that the ethical significance of human conduct is
a metaphysical one, in other words, that it stretches out beyond this
phaenomenal existence and reaches to eternity; but it is equally true
that the presentment of this fact in terms of Command and Obedience, of
Law and Duty, is no part of its essence. Furthermore, separated from
the theological hypotheses whence they have sprung, these conceptions
lose in reality all meaning, and to attempt a substitute for the
former by talking with Kant of <b>absolute</b> obligation and of
<b>unconditioned</b> duty, is to feed the reader with empty words, nay
more, is to give him a <i>contradictio in adjecto</i><a name="FNanchor_3_18" id="FNanchor_3_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_18" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to digest.</p>

<p>Every obligation derives all sense and meaning; simply and solely from
its relation to threatened punishment or promised reward. Hence, long
before Kant was thought of, Locke says: "For since it would be utterly
in vain, to suppose a rule set to the free actions of man, without
annexing to it some enforcement of good and evil to determine his
will; we must, wherever we suppose a law, suppose also some reward or
punishment annexed to that law." (<i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>,
Bk. II., ch. 33, § 6). What <b>ought</b> to be done is therefore
necessarily conditioned by punishment or reward; consequently, to use
Kant's language, it is essentially and inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> <b>hypothetical</b>,
and never, as he maintains, <b>categorical</b>. If we think away these
conditions, the conception of obligation becomes void of sense; hence
absolute obligation is most certainly a <i>contradictio in adjecto.</i>
A commanding voice, whether it come from within, or from without,
cannot possibly be imagined except as threatening or promising.
Consequently obedience to it, which may be wise or foolish according
to circumstances, is yet always actuated by selfishness, and therefore
morally worthless.</p>

<p>The complete unthinkableness and nonsense of this conception of an
<b>unconditioned obligation</b>, which lies at the root of the Kantian
Ethics, appears later in the system itself, namely in the <i>Kritik der
Praktischen Vernunft</i>: just as some concealed poison in an organism
cannot remain hid, but sooner or later must come out and show itself.
For this <b>obligation</b>, said to be so <b>unconditioned</b>,
nevertheless postulates more than one condition in the background; it
assumes a rewarder, a reward, and the immortality of the person to be
rewarded.</p>

<p>This is of course unavoidable, if one really makes Duty and Obligation
the fundamental conception of Ethics; for these ideas are essentially
relative, and depend for their significance on the threatened penalty
or the promised reward. The guerdon which is assumed to be in store
for virtue shows clearly enough that only in appearance she works
for nothing. It is, however, put forward modestly veiled, under the
name of the <b>Highest Good</b>, which is the union of Virtue and
Happiness. But this is at bottom nothing else but a morality that
derives its origin from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> Happiness, which means, a morality resting on
selfishness. In other words, it is Eudaemonism, which Kant had solemnly
thrust out of the front door of his system as an intruder, only to
let it creep in again by the postern under the name of the <b>Highest
Good</b>. This is how the assumption of <b>unconditioned absolute
obligation</b>, concealing as it does a contradiction, avenges itself.
<b>Conditioned</b> obligation, on the other hand, cannot of course be
any first principle for Ethics, since everything done out of regard for
reward or punishment is necessarily an egoistic transaction, and as
such is without any real moral value. All this makes it clear that a
nobler and wider view of Ethics is needed, if we are in earnest about
our endeavour to truly account for the significance of human conduct&mdash;a
significance which extends beyond phaenomena and is eternal.</p>

<p>As all obligation is entirely dependent on a condition, so also is
all duty. Both conceptions are very closely related, indeed almost
identical. The only difference between them might be said to be that
obligation in general may rest on mere force, whereas duty involves
the sense of obligation deliberately undertaken, such as we see
between master and servant, principal and subordinate, rulers and the
ruled. And since no one undertakes a duty <i>gratis,</i> every duty implies
also a right. The slave has no duties, because he has no rights; but
he is subject to an obligation which rests on sheer force. In the
following Part I shall explain the only meaning which the conception
"<b>Duty</b>" has in Ethics.</p>

<p>If we put Ethics in an <b>imperative</b> form, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> it a Doctrine of
Duties, and regard the moral worth or worthlessness of human conduct
as the fulfilment or violation of duties, we must remember that this
view of Duty, and of Obligation in general, is undeniably derived
solely from theological Morals, and primarily from the Decalogue,
and consequently that it rests essentially and inseparably on the
assumption of man's dependence on another will which gives him commands
and announces reward or punishment. But the more the assumption of
such a will is in Theology positive and precise, the less should it
be quietly and unsuspectingly introduced into philosophical Morals.
Hence we have no right to assume beforehand that for the latter the
<b>imperative Form</b>, the ordaining of commands, laws, and duties
is an essential and a matter of course; and it is a very poor shift
to substitute the word "absolute" or "categorical" for the external
condition which is indissolubly attached to such conceptions by
their very nature: for this gives rise, as explained above, to a
<i>contradictio in adjecto</i>.</p>

<p>Kant, then, without more ado or any close examination, borrowed
this <b>imperative Form</b> of Ethics from theological Morals. The
hypotheses of the latter (in other words, Theology) really lie at
the root of his system, and as these alone in point of fact lend
it any meaning or sense, so they cannot be separated from, indeed
are implicitly contained in, it. After this, when he had expounded
his position the task of developing in turn a Theology out of his
Morals&mdash;the famous <i>Moraltheologie</i>&mdash;was easy enough. For the
conceptions which are implicitly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> involved in his Imperative, and which
lie hidden at the base of his Morals, only required to be brought
forward and expressed explicitly as postulates of Practical Reason. And
so it was that, to the world's great edification, a Theology appeared
depending simply on Ethics, indeed actually derived therefrom. But
this came about because the ethical system itself rests on concealed
theological hypotheses. I mean no derisive comparison, but in its form
the process is analogous to that whereby a conjurer prepares a surprise
for us, when he lets us find something where he had previously employed
his art to place it. Described in the abstract, Kant's procedure is
this: what ought to have been his first principle, or hypothesis
(<i>viz</i>., Theology) he made the conclusion, and what ought to have been
deduced as the conclusion (<i>viz</i>., the Categorical Command) he took as
his hypothesis.<a name="FNanchor_4_19" id="FNanchor_4_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_19" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But after he had thus turned the thing upside down,
nobody, not even he himself, recognised it as being what it really was,
namely the old well-known system of theological Morals. How this trick
was accomplished we shall consider in the sixth and seventh chapters of
the present Part.</p>

<p>Ethics was of course frequently put in the imperative form, and treated
as a doctrine of duties also in pre-Kantian philosophy; but it was
always then based upon the will of a God whose existence had been
otherwise proved, and so there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> inconsequence. As soon, however,
as the attempt was made, as Kant attempted, to give a foundation to
Ethics independent of this will, and establish it without metaphysical
hypotheses, there was no longer any justification for taking as its
basis the words "thou shalt," and "it is thy duty" (that is, the
imperative form), without first deducing the truth thereof from some
other source.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IIIb" id="CHAPTER_IIIb">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<h3>ON THE ASSUMPTION OF DUTIES TOWARDS OURSELVES IN PARTICULAR.</h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>This form of the doctrine of duties was very acceptable to Kant,
and in working out his position he left it untouched; for, like his
predecessors, along with the duties towards others he ranged also
duties towards ourselves. I, however, entirely reject this assumption,
and, as there will be no better opportunity, I shall here incidentally
explain my view.</p>

<p>Duties towards ourselves must, just as all others, be based either
on right or on love. Duties towards ourselves based on right are
impossible, because of the self-evident fundamental principle <i>volenti
non fit injuria</i> (where the will assents, no injury is done). For what
I do is always what I will; consequently also what I do to myself is
never anything but what I will, therefore it cannot be unjust. Next, as
regards duties towards ourselves based on love. Ethics here finds her
work already done, and comes too late. The impossibility of violating
the duty of self-love is at once assumed by the first law of Christian
Morals: "Love thy neighbour as thyself." According to this, the love
which each man cherishes for himself is postulated as the <i>maximum</i>,
and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> the condition of all other love; while the converse, "Love
thyself as thy neighbour" is never added; for every one would feel that
the latter does not claim enough. Moreover, self-love would be the sole
duty regularly involving an <i>opus supererogationis</i>. Kant himself says
in the <i>Metaphysische Anfangsgründe zur Tugendlehre</i>, p. 13 (R., p.
230): "That which each man inevitably wills of himself, does not belong
to the conception of Duty." This idea of duties towards ourselves is
nevertheless still held in repute, indeed it enjoys for the most part
special favour; nor need we feel surprise. But it has an amusing effect
in cases where people begin to show anxiety about their persons, and
talk quite earnestly of the duty of self-preservation; the while it is
sufficiently clear that fear will lend them legs soon enough, and that
they have no need of any law of duty to help them along.</p>

<p>First among the duties towards ourselves is generally placed that of
not committing suicide, the line of argument taken being extremely
prejudiced and resting on the shallowest basis. Unlike animals, man is
not only a prey to <b>bodily</b> pain limited to the passing moment,
but also to those incomparably greater <b>mental</b> sufferings, which,
reaching forwards and backwards, draw upon the future and the past; and
nature, by way of compensation, has granted to man alone the privilege
of being able to end his life at his own pleasure, before she herself
sets a term to it; thus, while animals necessarily live so long as they
can, man need only live so long as he <b>will</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether he ought on ethical grounds to forego this privilege is a
difficult question, which in any case cannot be decided by the usual
superficial reasoning. The arguments against suicide which Kant does
not deem unworthy of adducing (p. 53, R., p. 48 and p. 67, R., p.
57), I cannot conscientiously describe as other than pitiable, and
quite undeserving of an answer. It is laughable indeed to suppose that
reflections of such a kind could have wrested the dagger from the hands
of Cato, of Cleopatra, of Cocceius Nerva (Tac. <i>Ann</i>., vi. 26) or of
Arria the wife of Paetus (Plin., <i>Ep</i>., iii. 16). If real moral motives
for not committing suicide actually exist, it is certain that they lie
very deep, and cannot be reached by the plummet of ordinary Ethics.
They belong to a higher view of things than is adaptable even to the
standpoint of the present treatise.<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>That which generally comes next on the rubric of duties towards
ourselves may be divided partly into rules of worldly wisdom, partly
into hygienic prescriptions; but neither class belongs to Morals in the
proper sense. Last on the catalogue comes the prohibition of unnatural
lust&mdash;onanism, <i>paederastia,</i> and bestiality. Of these onanism is
mainly a vice of childhood, and must be fought against much more with
the weapon of dietetics than with that of ethics; hence we find that
the authors of books directed against it are physicians (<i>e.g.</i>,
Tissot and others) rather than moralists. After dietetics and hygiene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
have done their work, and struck it down by irrefutable reasoning, if
Ethics desires to take up the matter, she finds little left for her to
do. Bestiality, again, is of very rare occurrence; it is thoroughly
abnormal and exceptional, and, moreover, so loathsome and foreign to
human nature, that itself, better than all arguments of reason, passes
judgment on itself, and deters by sheer disgust. For the rest, as being
a degradation of human nature, it is in reality an offence against the
species as such, and in the abstract; not against human units. Of the
three sexual perversions of which we are speaking it is consequently
only with <i>paederastia</i> that Ethics has to do, and in treating of
Justice this vice finds its proper place. For Justice is infringed by
it, in face of which fact, the dictum <i>volenti non fit injuria</i> is
unavailing. The injustice consists in the seduction of the younger and
inexperienced person, who is thereby ruined physically and morally.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IVb" id="CHAPTER_IVb">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h3>ON THE BASIS OF THE KANTIAN ETHICS.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>With the imperative Form of Ethics, which in Chapter II. we proved to
be a <i>petitio principii</i>, is directly connected a favourite idea of
Kant's, that may be excused, but cannot be adopted. Sometimes we see
a physician, after having employed a certain remedy with conspicuous
success, henceforth prescribing it for almost all diseases; to such
a one Kant may be likened. By separating the <i>a priori</i> from the
<i>a posteriori</i> in human knowledge he made the most brilliant and
pregnant discovery that Metaphysics can boast of. What wonder then
that thereafter he should try to apply this method, this sundering of
the two forms, everywhere, and should consequently make Ethics also
consist of two parts, a pure, <i>i.e.</i> an <i>a priori</i> knowable part, and
an empirical? The latter of these he rejects as unreliable for the
purpose of founding Ethics. To trace out the former and; exhibit it by
itself is his purpose in the <i>Grundlegung der Metaphysik der Sitten</i>,
which he accordingly represents as a science purely <i>a priori</i>, exactly
in the same way as he sets forth the <i>Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der
Naturwissenschaft</i>. He asserts in fact that the <b>Moral Law</b>,
which without warrant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> without deduction, or proof of any sort, he
postulates as existing, is furthermore a Law knowable <i>a priori</i> and
independent of all <b>internal</b> or <b>external experience</b>; it
"<i>rests</i>" (he says) "<b>solely on conceptions of pure Reason; and is
to be taken as a synthetic proposition a priori</b>" (<i>Kritik der
Praktischen Vernunft</i>: p. 56 of fourth Edition; R., p. 142). But
from this definition the implication immediately follows that such a
Law can only be formal, like everything else known <i>a priori</i>, and
consequently has only to do with the <b>Form</b> of actions, not
with their <b>Essence</b>. Let it be thought what this means! He
emphatically adds (p. vi of the preface to the <i>Grundlegung;</i> R., p. 5)
that it is "useless to look for it either subjectively in man's nature,
or objectively in the accidents of the external world," and (preface
of the same, page vii; R., p. 6) that "nothing whatever connected
with it can be borrowed from knowledge relating to man, <i>i.e.</i>, from
anthropology." On page 59 (R., p. 52) he repeats, "That one ought on no
account to fall into the mistake of trying to derive one's principle of
morality from the special constitution of human nature"; and again, on
page 60 (R., p. 52), he says that, "Everything derived from any natural
disposition peculiar to man, or from certain feelings and propensities,
or indeed from any special trend attaching solely to human nature,
and not necessarily to be taken as the Will of <b>every rational
being</b>," is incapable of affording a foundation for the moral law.
This shows beyond all possibility of contradiction that Kant does not
represent the alleged moral law as a <i>fact of consciousness</i>, capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of empirical proof&mdash;which is how the later would-be philosophers, both
individually and collectively, wish to pass it off. In discarding every
empirical basis for Morals, he rejects all internal, and still more
decidedly all external, experience., Accordingly he founds&mdash;and I call
special attention to this&mdash;his moral principle not on any provable
<i>fact of consciousness</i>, such as an inner natural disposition, nor yet
upon any objective relation of things in the external world. No! That
would be an empirical foundation. Instead of this, <i>pure conceptions
a priori</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, conceptions, which so far contain nothing derived
from internal or external experience, and thus are simply shells
without kernels&mdash;these are to be made the basis of Morals. Let us
consider the full meaning of such a position. Human consciousness as
well as the whole external world, together with all the experience and
all the facts they comprise, are swept from under our feet. We have
nothing to stand upon. And what have we to hold to? Nothing but a few
entirely abstract, entirely unsubstantial conceptions, floating in the
air equally with ourselves. It is from these, or, more correctly, from
the mere form of their connection with judgments made, that a <i>Law</i> is
declared to proceed, which by so-called <b>absolute necessity</b> is
supposed to be valid, and to be strong enough to lay bit and bridle on
the surging throng of human desires, on the storm of passion, on the
giant might of <i>egoism</i>. We shall see if such be the case.</p>

<p>With this preconceived notion that the basis of Morals must be
necessarily and strictly a priori, and entirely free from everything
empirical, another of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Kant's favourite ideas is closely connected.
The moral principle that he seeks to establish is, he says, a
<b>synthetic proposition a priori, of merely formal contents</b>, and
hence exclusively a matter of <b>Pure Reason</b>; and accordingly,
as such, to be regarded as valid <b>not only for men</b>, but for
<b>all possible rational beings</b>; indeed he declares it to hold
good for man "on this account alone," <i>i.e.</i>, because <i>per accidens</i>
man comes under the category of rational beings. Here lies the cause
of his basing the Moral principle not on any feeling, but on <b>pure
Reason</b> (which knows nothing but itself and the statement of its
antithesis). So that this <b>pure Reason</b> is taken, not as it
really and exclusively is&mdash;an intellectual faculty of man&mdash;but <b>as
a self-existent hypostatic essence</b>, yet without the smallest
authority; the pernicious effects of such example and precedent being
sufficiently shown in the pitiful philosophy of the present day.
Indeed, this view of Morals as existing not for men, as men, but for
all rational beings, as such, is with Kant a principle so firmly
established, an idea so favourite, that he is never tired of repeating
it at every opportunity.</p>

<p>I, on the contrary, maintain that we are never entitled to raise
into a <i>genus</i> that which we only know of in a single species. For
we could bring nothing into our idea of the <i>genus</i> but what we had
abstracted from this one species; so that what we should predicate of
the <i>genus</i> could after all only be understood of the single species.
While, if we should attempt to think away (without any warrant) the
particular attributes of the species, in order to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> our <i>genus</i>,
we should perhaps remove the exact condition whereby the remaining
attributes, hypostatised as a <i>genus</i>, are made possible. Just as we
recognise <b>intelligence in general</b> to be an attribute of animal
beings alone, and are therefore never justified in thinking of it as
existing outside, and independent, of animal nature; so we recognise
<b>Reason</b> as the exclusive attribute of the human race, and have
not the smallest right to suppose that Reason exists externally to
it, and then proceed to set up a <i>genus</i> called "Rational Beings,"
differing from its single known species "Man"; still less are we
warranted in laying down laws for such imaginary <b>rational beings
in the abstract</b>. To talk of rational beings external to men is
like talking of <b>heavy beings</b> external to bodies. One cannot
help suspecting that Kant was thinking a little of the dear cherubim,
or at any rate counted on their presence in the conviction of the
reader. In any case this doctrine contains a tacit assumption of an
<i>anima rationalis,</i> which as being entirely different from the <i>anima
sensitiva</i>, and the <i>anima vegetativa</i>, is supposed to persist after
death, and then to be indeed nothing else but <i>rationalis</i>. But in the
<i>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</i> Kant himself has expressly and elaborately
made an end of this most transcendent hypostasis. Nevertheless, in
his ethics generally, and in the <i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i>
especially, there seems always to hover in the background the thought
that the inner and eternal essence, of man consists of <b>Reason</b>.
In this connection, where the matter only occurs incidentally, I must
content myself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> simply asserting the contrary. Reason, as indeed
the intellectual faculty as a whole, is secondary, is an attribute of
phaenomena, being in point of fact conditioned by the organism; whereas
it is the <b>Will</b> in man which is his very self, the only part of
him which is metaphysical, and therefore indestructible.</p>

<p>The success with which Kant had applied his method to the theoretical
side of philosophy led him on to extend it to the practical. Here
also he endeavoured to separate pure <i>a priori</i> from empirical <i>a
posteriori</i> knowledge. For this purpose he assumed that just as
we know <i>a priori</i> the laws of Space, of Time, and of Causality,
so in like manner, or at any rate analogously, we have the moral
plumb-line for our conduct given us prior to all experience, and
revealed in a Categorical Imperative, an absolute "Ought." But how
wide is the difference between this alleged moral law <i>a priori</i>, and
our theoretical knowledge <i>a priori</i> of Space, Time, and Causality!
The latter are nothing but the expression of the forms, <i>i.e.</i>, the
functions of our intellect, whereby alone we are capable of grasping
an objective world, and wherein alone it can be mirrored; so that the
world (as we know it) is absolutely conditioned by these forms, and all
experience <b>must</b> invariably and exactly correspond to them&mdash;just
as everything that I see through a blue glass must appear blue. While
the former, the so-called moral law, is something that experience pours
ridicule on at every step; indeed, as Kant himself says, it is doubtful
whether in practice it has ever really been followed on any single
occasion. How completely unlike are the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> which are here classed
together under the conception of <b>apriority</b>! Moreover, Kant
overlooked the fact that, according to his own teaching, in theoretical
philosophy, it is exactly the <b>Apriority</b> of our knowledge of
Time, Space, and Causality&mdash;independent as this is of experience&mdash;that
limits it strictly to phaenomena, <i>i.e.</i>, to the picture of the world
as reflected in our consciousness, and makes it entirely invalid as
regards the real nature of things, <i>i.e.</i>, as regards whatever exists
independently of our capacity to grasp it.</p>

<p>Similarly, when we turn to practical philosophy, his alleged moral
law, if it have an <i>a priori</i> origin in ourselves, must also be only
phaenomenal, and leave entirely untouched the essential nature of
things. Only this conclusion would stand in the sharpest contradiction
as much to the facts themselves, as to Kant's view of them. For it is
precisely the moral principle in us that he everywhere (<i>e.g., Kritik
der Praktischen Vernunft</i>, p. 175; R., p. 228) represents as being in
the closest connection with the real essence of things, indeed, as
directly in contact with it; and in all passages in the <i>Kritik der
Reinen Vernunft,</i> where the mysterious Thing in itself comes forward a
little more clearly, it shows itself as the <b>moral principle</b> in
us, as <b>Will</b>. But of this he failed to take account.</p>

<p>In Chapter II. of this Part, I explained how Kant took over bodily
from theological Morals the <b>imperative form</b> of Ethics, <i>i.e.</i>,
the conception of obligation, of law, and of duty; and how at the same
time he was constrained to leave behind that which in the realm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> of
theology alone lends force and significance to these ideas. But he
felt the need of some basis for them, and accordingly went so far as
to require that the <i>conception of duty</i> itself should be also the
<i>ground of its fulfilment</i>; in other words, that it should itself be
its own enforcement. An action, he says (p. 11; R., p. 18), has no
genuine moral worth, unless it be done simply as a matter of duty,
and for duty's sake, without any liking for it being felt; and the
character only begins to have value, if a man, who has no sympathy in
his heart, and is cold and indifferent to others' sufferings, and who
is <b>not by nature a lover of his kind</b>, is nevertheless a doer of
good actions, solely out of a pitiful sense of duty. This assertion,
which is revolting to true moral sentiment; this apotheosis of
lovelessness, the exact opposite, as it is, of the Christian doctrine
of Morals, which places love before everything else, and teaches that
without it nothing profiteth (1 Cor. xiii. 3); this stupid moral
pedantry has been ridiculed by Schiller in two apposite epigrams,
entitled <i>Gewissensskrupel</i> (Scruples of Conscience) and <i>Entscheidung</i>
(Decision).<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It appears that some passages in the <i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i>,
which exactly suit this connection, were the immediate occasion of the
verses. Thus, for instance, on p. 150 (R., p. 211) we find: "Obedience
to the moral law, which a man feels incumbent on him, is based not on
voluntary inclination, nor on endeavour willingly put forth, without
any authoritative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> command, but on a sense of duty." Yes, it must be
commanded! What slavish morality! And again on p. 213 (R., p. 257):
"Feelings of compassion, and of tender-hearted sympathy would be
actually troublesome to persons who think aright, because through such
emotions their well weighed maxims would become confused, and so the
desire would grow up to be rid of them, and to be subject solely to
the lawgiver&mdash;Reason." Now I maintain without hesitation that what
opens the hand of the above-described (p. 11; R., p. 18) loveless doer
of good, who is indifferent to the sufferings of other people, cannot
(provided he have no secondary motives) be anything else than a slavish
<i>δεισιδαιμονία</i> (fear of the gods), equally whether he calls his fetich
"Categorical Imperative" or Fitzlipuzli.<a name="FNanchor_2_22" id="FNanchor_2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_22" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For what but fear can move
a hard heart?</p>

<p>Furthermore, on p. 13 (R., p. 19), in accordance with the above view,
we find that the moral worth of an action is supposed to lie, by
no means in the <b>intention</b> which led to it, but in the maxim
which was followed. Whereas I, on the contrary, ask the reader to
reflect that it is the <b>intention alone</b> which decides as to the
moral worth, or worthlessness, off an action, so that the same act
may deserve condemnation or praise according to the intention which
determined it. Hence it is that, whenever men discuss a proceeding
to which some moral importance is attached, the <b>intention</b> is
always investigated, and by this standard alone the matter is judged;
as, likewise, it is in the <i>intention</i> alone that every one seeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
justification, if he see his conduct misinterpreted or excuse, if its
consequence be mischievous.</p>

<p>On p. 14 (R., p. 20) we at last reach the definition of Duty, which
is the fundamental conception of Kant's entire ethical system. It is:
"The necessity of an action out of respect for the law." But what is
<b>necessary</b> takes place with absolute certainty while conduct
based on pure duty generally does not come off at all. And not only
this; Kant himself admits (p. 25; R., p. 28) that there are <b>no
certain instances</b> on record of conduct determined solely by pure
duty; and on p. 26 (R., p. 29) he says: "It is utterly impossible to
know with certainty from experience whether there has ever really
been one single case in which an action, however true to duty, has
rested simply on its idea."&mdash;And similarly on p. 28 (R., p. 30)
and p. 49 (R., p. 50). In what sense then can <b>necessity</b> be
attributed to such an action? As it is only fair always to put the
most favourable interpretation on an author's words, we will suppose
him to mean that an act true to duty is <b>objectively</b> necessary,
but <b>subjectively</b> accidental. Only it is precisely this that
is more easily said than thought for where is the <b>Object</b> of
this <b>objective</b> necessity, the consequence of which for the
most part, perhaps indeed always, fails to be realised in objective
reality! With every wish to be unbiassed, I cannot but think that
the expression&mdash;<b>necessity of an action</b>&mdash;is nothing but an
artificially concealed, very forced paraphrase of the word "ought."<a name="FNanchor_3_23" id="FNanchor_3_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_23" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
This will become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> clearer if we notice that in the same definition the
word <i>Achtung</i> (respect) is employed, where <i>Gehorsam</i> (obedience) is
meant. Similarly in the note on p. 16 (R., p. 20) we read: "<i>Achtung</i>
signifies simply the subordination of my will to a law. The direct
determination of the will by a law, and the consciousness that it is
so determined&mdash;this is what is denoted by <i>Achtung</i>" In what language?
In German the proper term is <i>Gehorsam</i>. But the word <i>Achtung</i>, so
unsuitable as it is, cannot without a reason have been put in place of
the word <i>Gehorsam.</i> It must serve some purpose; and this is obviously
none other than to veil the derivation of the imperative form, and of
the conception of duty, from theological Morals; just as we saw above
that the expression "necessity of an action," which is such a forced
and awkward substitute for the word "shall," was only chosen because
"shall" is the exact language of the Decalogue. The above definition:
"Duty is the necessity of an action out of respect for the law," would
therefore read in natural, undisguised, plain language: "Duty signifies
an action which <b>ought</b> to be done out of obedience to a law."
This is "the real form of the poodle."<a name="FNanchor_4_24" id="FNanchor_4_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_24" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>But now as to the Law, which is the real foundation stone of the
Kantian Ethics. <b>What does it contain? And where is it inscribed?</b>
This is the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> point of inquiry. In the first place, be it observed
that we have two questions to deal with: the one has to do with the
<b>Principle</b>, the other with the <b>Basis</b> of Ethics&mdash;two
entirely different things, although they are frequently, and sometimes
indeed intentionally, confused.</p>

<p>The principle or main proposition of an ethical system is the shortest
and most concise definition of the line of conduct which it prescribes,
or, if it have no imperative form, of the line of conduct to which it
attaches real moral worth. It thus contains, in the general terms of
a single enunciation, the direction for following the path of virtue,
which is derived from that system: in other words, it is the <i>ὅ,τι</i><a name="FNanchor_5_25" id="FNanchor_5_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_25" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
of virtue. Whereas the <b>Basis</b> of any theory of Ethics is the
<i>διότι</i><a name="FNanchor_6_26" id="FNanchor_6_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_26" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of virtue, the <b>reason</b> of the obligation enjoined,
of the exhortation or praise given, whether it be sought in human
nature, or in the external conditions of the world, or in anything
else. As in all sciences, so also in Ethics the <i>ὅ,τι</i> must be clearly
distinguished from the <i>διότι</i>. But most teachers of Morals wilfully
confound this difference: probably because the <i>ὅ,τι</i> is so easy, the
<i>διότι</i> so exceedingly difficult, to give. They are therefore glad to
try to make up for the poverty on the one hand, by the riches on the
other, and to bring about a happy marriage between <i>Πενία</i> (poverty)
and <i>Πόρος</i> (plenty), by putting them together in one proposition.<a name="FNanchor_7_27" id="FNanchor_7_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_27" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
This is generally done by taking the familiar <i>ὅ,τι</i> out of the simple
form in which it can be expressed, and forcing it into an artificial
formula, from which it is only to be deduced as the conclusion of
given premises; and the reader is led by this performance to feel
as if he had grasped not only the thing, but its cause as well. We
may easily convince ourselves of this by recalling all the most
familiar principles of Morals. As, however, in what follows I have
no intention of imitating acrobatic tricks of this sort, but purpose
proceeding with all honesty and straightforwardness, I cannot make the
principle of Ethics equivalent to its basis, but must keep the two
quite separate. Accordingly, this <i>ὅ,τι</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the principle, the
fundamental proposition&mdash;as to which in its essence all teachers of
Morals are really at one, however much they may clothe it in different
costumes, I shall at once express in the form which I take to be
the simplest and purest possible, <i>viz.: Neminem laede, immo omnes,
quantum potes, juva</i>. (Do harm to no one; but rather help all people,
as far as lies in your power.) This is in truth the proposition which
all ethical writers expend their energies in endeavouring to account
for. It is the common result of their manifold and widely differing
deductions; it is the <i>ὅ,τι</i> for which the <i>διότι</i> is still sought
after; the consequence, the cause of which is wanting. Hence it is
itself nothing but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> <i>Datum</i> (the thing given), in relation to which
the <i>Quaesitum</i> (the thing required) is the problem of every ethical
system, as also of the present prize essay. The solution of this
riddle will disclose the real foundation of Ethics, which, like the
philosopher's stone, has been searched for from time immemorial. That
the <i>Datum</i>, the <i>ὅ,τι</i>, the principle is most purely expressed by the
enunciation I have given, can be seen from the fact that it stands to
every other precept of Morals as a conclusion to given premises, and
therefore constitutes the real goal it is desired to attain; so that
all other ethical commandments can only be regarded as paraphrases, as
indirect or disguised statements, of the above simple proposition. This
is true, for instance, even of that trite and apparently elementary
maxim: <i>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris</i><a name="FNanchor_8_28" id="FNanchor_8_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_28" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (Do not to
another what you are unwilling should be done to yourself.) The defect
here is that the wording only touches the duties imposed by law, not
those required by virtue;&mdash;a thing which can be easily remedied by
the omission of <i>non</i> and <i>ne</i>. Thus changed, it really means nothing
else than: <i>Neminem laede, immo omnes, quantum potes, juva.</i> But as
this sense is only reached by a periphrasis, the formula gains the
appearance of having also revealed its own ultimate foundation, its
<i>διότι</i>; which, however, is not the case, because it does not in the
least follow that, if I am unwilling that something be done to myself,
I ought not to do it to others. The same is true of every other
principle or leading proposition of Ethics that has hitherto been put
forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>If we now return to the above question:&mdash;how does the law read, in
obeying which, according to Kant, duty consists? and on what is it
based?&mdash;we shall find that our philosopher, like most others, has in an
extremely artificial manner closely connected the principle of Morals
with its basis. I again call attention to what I have already examined
at the outset&mdash;I mean, the Kantian claim that the principle of Ethics
must be purely <i>a priori</i> and purely formal, indeed an <i>a priori</i>
synthetical proposition, which consequently may not contain anything
material, nor rest upon anything empirical, whether objectively in
the external world, or subjectively in consciousness, such as any
feeling, inclination, impulse, and the like. Kant was perfectly aware
of the difficulty of this position; for on p. 60 (R., p. 53) he says:
"It will be seen that philosophy has here indeed reached a precarious
standpoint, which yet is to be immovable, notwithstanding that it
is neither dependent on, nor supported by, anything in heaven or on
earth." We shall therefore with all the greater interest and curiosity
await the solution of the problem he has set himself, namely, how
something is to arise out of nothing, that is, how out of purely <i>a
priori</i> conceptions, which contain nothing empirical or material, the
laws of material human action are to grow up. This is a process which
we may find symbolised in chemistry, where out of three invisible gases
(Azote, Hydrogen, and Chlorine<a name="FNanchor_9_29" id="FNanchor_9_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_29" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>), and thus in apparently empty space,
solid sal-ammoniac is evolved before our eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>I will, however, explain, more clearly than Kant either would or
could, the method whereby he accomplishes this difficult task. The
demonstration is all the more necessary because what he did appears
to be seldom properly understood. Almost all Kant's disciples have
fallen into the mistake of supposing that he presents his Categorical
Imperative directly as a fact of consciousness. But in that case
its origin would be anthropological, and, as resting on experience,
although internal, it would have an empirical basis: a position which
runs directly counter to the Kantian view, and which he repeatedly
rejects. Thus on p. 48 (R., p. 44) he says: "It cannot be empirically
determined whether any such Categorical Imperative exists everywhere";
and again, on p. 49 (R., p. 45): "The possibility of the Categorical
Imperative must be investigated entirely on <i>a priori</i> grounds,
because here we are not helped by any testimony of experience as to
its reality." Even Reinhold, his first pupil, missed this point; for
in his <i>Beitrage zur Uebersicht der Philosophie am Anfange des</i> 19.
<i>Jahrhunderts</i>, No. 2, p. 21, we find him saying: "Kant assumes the
moral law to be a direct and certain reality, an original fact of the
moral consciousness." But if Kant had wished to make the Categorical
Imperative a fact of consciousness, and thus give it an empirical
foundation, he certainly would not have failed at least to put it
forward as such. And this is precisely what he never does. As far as
I know, the Categorical Imperative appears for the first time in the
<i>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</i> (p. 802 of the first, and p. 830 of the
fifth edition), entirely ex nunc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> (unexpectedly), without any preamble,
and merely connected with the preceding sentence by an altogether
unjustifiable "therefore."; It is only in the <i>Grundlage zur Metaphysik
der Sitten</i>&mdash;a book to which we here devote especial attention&mdash;that
it is first introduced expressly and formally, as a deduction from
certain concepts. Whereas in Reinhold's <i>Formula concordiae des
Kriticismus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_30" id="FNanchor_10_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_30" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we actually read on p. 122 the following sentence:
"We distinguish moral self-consciousness from the <b>experience</b>
with which it, as an original fact transcending all knowledge, is
bound up in the human consciousness; and we understand by such
self-consciousness the <b>direct consciousness of duty</b>, that is, of
the <b>necessity</b> we are under of admitting the legitimacy&mdash;whether
pleasurable or the reverse&mdash;of the will, as the stimulus and as the
measure of its own operations."</p>

<p>This would of course be "a charming <i>thesis</i>, with a very pretty
<i>hypothesis</i> to boot."<a name="FNanchor_11_31" id="FNanchor_11_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_31" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But seriously: into what an outrageous
<i>petitio principii</i> do we find Kant's moral law here developed! If
<b>that</b> were true, Ethics would indubitably have a basis of
incomparable solidity, and there would be no need of any questions
being set for prize essays, to encourage inquiry in this direction.
But the greatest marvel would be, that men had been so slow in
discovering such a fact of consciousness, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> that for the
space of thousands of years a basis for Morals has been sought after
with zealous patient toil. How Kant himself is responsible for this
deplorable mistake, I shall explain further on; nevertheless, one
cannot but wonder at the undisputed predominance of such a radical
error among his disciples. Have they never, whilst writing all their
numberless books on the Kantian philosophy, noticed the disfigurement
which the <i>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</i> underwent in the second
edition, and which made it an incoherent, self-contradictory work?
It seems that this has only now come to light; and, in my opinion,
the fact has been quite correctly analysed in Rosenkranz's preface to
the second volume of his complete edition of Kant's works. We must,
however, remember that many scholars, being unceasingly occupied as
teachers and authors, find very little time left for private and exact
research. It is certain that <i>docendo disco</i> (I learn by teaching) is
not unconditionally true; sometimes indeed one is tempted to parody
it by saying: <i>semper docendo nihil disco</i> (by always teaching I
learn nothing); and even what Diderot puts into the mouth of Rameau's
nephew is not altogether without reason: "'And as for these teachers,
do you suppose they understand the sciences they give instruction
in? Not a bit of it, my dear sir, not a bit of it. If they possessed
sufficient knowledge to be able to teach them, they would not do so.'
'Why?' 'Because they would have devoted their lives to the study of
them.'"&mdash;(Goethe's translation, p. 104.) Lichtenberg too says: "I have
rather observed that professional people are often exactly those who
do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> not know best." But to return to the Kantian Ethics: most persons,
provided only the conclusion reached agrees with their moral feelings,
immediately assume that there is no flaw to be found in its derivation;
and if the process of deduction looks difficult, they do not trouble
themselves much about it, but are content to trust the faculty.</p>

<p>Thus the foundation which Kant gave to his moral law by no means
consists in its being proved empirically to be a fact of consciousness;
neither does he base it on an appeal to moral feeling, nor yet on
a <i>petitio principii</i>, under its fine modern name of an "absolute
Postulate." It is formed rather of a very subtle process of thought,
which he twice advances, on p. 17 and p. 51 (R., p. 22, and p. 46), and
which I shall now proceed to make clear.</p>

<p>Kant, be it observed, ridiculed all empirical stimuli of the will,
and began by removing everything, whether subjective or objective, on
which a law determining the will's action could be empirically based.
The consequence is, that he has nothing left for the substance of his
law but simply its <b>Form</b>. Now this can only be the abstract
conception of <b>lawfulness</b>. But the conception of lawfulness
is built up out of what is valid for all persons equally. Therefore
the substance of the law consists of the conception of what is
universally valid, and its contents are of course nothing else than its
<b>universal validity</b>. Hence the formula will read as follows: "Act
only in accordance with that precept which you can also wish should
be a general law for all rational beings." This, then, is the real
foundation&mdash;for the most part so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> greatly misunderstood&mdash;which Kant
constructed for his principle of Morals, and therefore for his whole
ethical system. Compare also the <i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i>, p.
61 (R., p. 147); the end of Note 1.</p>

<p>I pay Kant a tribute of sincere admiration for the great acumen he
displayed in carrying out this dexterous feat, but I continue in
all seriousness my examination of his position according to the
standard of truth. I will only observe&mdash;and this point I shall take
up again later on&mdash;that here <b>reason</b>, because, and in so far
as, it works out the above explained special ratiocination, receives
the name of <b>practical reason</b>. Now the Categorical Imperative
of Practical Reason is the law which results from this process of
thought. Consequently Practical Reason is not in the least what most
people, including even Fichte, have regarded it&mdash;a special faculty
that cannot be traced to its source, a <i>qualitas occulta</i>, a sort of
moral instinct, like Hutcheson's "moral sense"; but it is (as Kant
himself in his preface, p. xii. [R., p. 8], and elsewhere, often enough
declares) one and the same with <b>theoretical reason</b>&mdash;is, in fact,
<b>theoretical reason</b> itself, in so far as the latter works out the
ratiocinative process I have described. It is noticeable that Fichte
calls the Categorical Imperative of Kant an <b>absolute Postulate</b>
(<i>Grundlage der gesammten Wissenschaftslehre</i>, Tübingen, 1802, p.
240, Note). This is the modern, more showy, expression for <i>petitio
principii</i>, and thus we see that he, too, regularly accepted the
Categorical Imperative, and consequently must be included among those
who have fallen into the mistake above criticised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The objection, to which this Kantian basis of Morals is at once and
directly exposed, lies in the fact that such an origin of a moral law
in us is impossible, because of its assumption that man would quite
of his own accord hit on the idea of looking about for, and inquiring
after, a law to which his will should be subject, and which should
shape its actions. This procedure, however, cannot possibly occur to
him of itself; at best it could only be after another moral; stimulus
had supplied the first impulse and motive thereto; and such a stimulus
would have to be positively operative, and real; and show itself to be
such, as well as spontaneously influence, indeed force its presence
upon, the mind. But anything of this sort would run counter to Kant's
assumption, which, according to the chain of reasoning above described,
is to be regarded as itself the origin of all moral conceptions&mdash;in
fact, the <i>punctum saliens</i> of Morality. Consequently, as long as there
is no such antecedent incentive (because, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, there exists
no other moral stimulus but the process of thought already explained),
so long Egoism alone must remain as the plumb-line of human conduct,
as the guiding thread of the law of motivation; so long the entirely
empirical and egoistic motives of the moment, alone and unchecked,
must determine, in each separate case, the conduct of a man; since,
on this assumption, there is no voice to arrest him, neither does any
reason whatever exist, why he should be minded to inquire after, to
say nothing of anxiously searching for, a law which should limit and
govern his will. And yet it is only possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> on this supposition that
he should think out the above remarkable piece of mental legerdemain.
It matters not how far we may care to put a strict and exact
interpretation on this Kantian process, or whether we choose to tone it
down to some dim, obscurely felt operation of thought. No modification
of it can attack the primary truths that out of nothing, nothing
comes, and that an effect requires a cause. The moral stimulus, like
every motive that effects the will, must in all cases make itself felt
spontaneously, and therefore have a positive working, and consequently
be real. And because for men the only thing which has reality is the
empirical, or else that which is supposed to have a possibly empirical
existence, therefore it follows that the moral stimulus cannot but
be empirical, and show itself as such of its own accord; and without
waiting for us to begin our search, it must come and press itself upon
us, and this with such force that it may, at least possibly, overcome
the opposing egoistic motives in all their giant strength. For Ethics
has to do with actual human conduct, and not with the <i>a priori</i>
building of card houses&mdash;a performance which yields results that no man
would ever turn to in the stern stress and battle of life, and which,
in face of the storm of our passions, would be about as serviceable as
a syringe in a great fire.</p>

<p>I have already noticed above how Kant considered it a special merit of
his moral law that it is founded solely on abstract, pure <i>a priori</i>
conceptions, consequently on <b>pure reason</b>; whereby its validity
obtains (he says) not only for men, but for all rational beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> as
such. All the more must we regret that pure, abstract conceptions <i>a
priori</i>, without real contents, and without any kind of empirical
basis can never move, at any rate, men; of other rational beings
I am of course incapable of speaking. The second defect, then, in
Kant's ethical basis is its lack of real substance. So far this has
escaped notice, because the real nature of his foundation has in all
probability been thoroughly understood only by an exceedingly small
number of those who were its enthusiastic propagandists. The second
fault, I repeat, is entire want of reality, and hence of possible
efficacy. The structure floats in the air, like a web of the subtlest
conceptions devoid of all contents; it is based on nothing, and can
therefore support nothing, and move nothing. And yet Kant loaded it
with a burden of enormous weight, namely, the hypothesis of the Freedom
of the Will. In spite of his oft declared conviction that freedom in
human action has absolutely no place; that theoretically not even its
possibility is thinkable (<i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i>, p. 168;
R., p. 223); that, if the character of a man, and all the motives which
work on him were exactly known, his conduct could be calculated as
certainly and as precisely as an eclipse of the moon (<i>ibidem</i>, p. 177;
R., p. 230): he nevertheless makes an assumption of freedom (although
only <i>idealiter</i>, and as a postulate) by his celebrated conclusion:
"You can, because you ought"; and this on the strength of his precious
ethical basis, which, as we see, floats in the air incorporeal. But if
it has once been clearly recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> that a thing <b>is not</b>, and
<b>cannot be</b>, what is the use of all the postulates in the world?
It would be much more to the purpose to cast away that on which the
postulate is based, because it is an impossible supposition; and this
course would be justified by the rule <i>a non posse ad non esse valet
consequentia</i>;<a name="FNanchor_12_32" id="FNanchor_12_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_32" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and by a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, which would at the
same time be fatal to the Categorical Imperative. Instead of which one
false doctrine is built up on the other.</p>

<p>The inadmissibility of a basis for Morals consisting of a few entirely
abstract and empty conceptions must have been apparent to Kant himself
in secret. For in the <i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i>, where (as I
have already said) he is not so strict and methodical in his work, and
where we find him becoming bolder on account of the fame he had gained,
it is remarkable how the ethical basis gradually changes its nature,
and almost forgets that it is a mere web of abstract ideas; in fact,
it seems distinctly desirous of becoming more substantial. Thus, for
instance, on p. 81 (R., p. 163) of the above work are the words: "The
Moral Law <b>in some sort a fact of Pure Reason</b>." What is one to
think of this extraordinary expression? In every other place that which
is fact is opposed to what is knowable by pure reason. Similarly on
p. 83 (R., p. 164) we read of "a Reason which directly determines the
Will"; and so on.</p>

<p>Now let us remember that in laying his foundation Kant expressly and
repeatedly rejects every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> anthropological basis, everything that
could prove the Categorical Imperative to be a fact of consciousness,
because such a proof would be empirical. Nevertheless, his successors
were so emboldened by incidental utterances like the above that
they went to much greater lengths. Fichte in his work, <i>System der
Sittenlehre</i>, p. 49, warns us expressly "not to allow ourselves to be
misled into trying to explain, and derive from external sources, the
consciousness that we have duties, because this would be detrimental
to the dignity and absoluteness of the law." A very nice excuse! Again
on p. 66 he says: "The principle of Morality is a thought which is
based on the <b>intellectual intuition</b> of the absolute activity
of the intelligence, and which is directly conceived by the pure
intelligence of its own accord." What a fine flourish to conceal the
helplessness of this clap-trap! Whoever may like to convince himself
how Kant's disciples, little by little, totally forgot and ignored
the real nature of the foundation and derivation which their master
originally gave to the moral law, should read a very interesting essay
in Reinhold's <i>Beitrage zur Uebersicht der Philosophie im Anfange des</i>
19. <i>Jahrhunderts</i>, No. 2, 1801. In it, on pp. 105 and 106, it is
maintained "that in the Kantian philosophy Autonomy (which is the same
thing as the Categorical Imperative) is a fact of consciousness, and
cannot be traced further back, inasmuch as it declares itself by means
of a direct consciousness."</p>

<p>But in this case, it would have an anthropological, and consequently
empirical, foundation&mdash;a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> which is diametrically opposed to
Kant's explicit and repeated utterances. Again, on p. 108 we find:
"Both in the practical philosophy of criticism, and in the whole of the
purified or higher transcendental philosophy, Autonomy is that which
is founded, and which founds, by itself alone; and which is neither
capable of, nor requires, any other foundation; it is that which is
absolutely original, true and certain <i>per se;</i> the primal truth; the
<i>prius κατ' ἐξοχήν (par excellence)</i>; the absolute principle. Whoever,
therefore, imagines, requires, or seeks any basis for this Autonomy
external to itself, can only be regarded by the Kantian School as
wanting in moral consciousness;<a name="FNanchor_13_33" id="FNanchor_13_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_33" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> or else as failing to interpret
this consciousness correctly, through the employment of false first
principles in his speculations. The School of Fichte and Schelling
declares him to be afflicted with a dulness of intellect that renders
him incapable of being a philosopher, and forms the characteristic of
the unholy <i>canaille</i>, and the sluggish brute, or (to use Schelling's
more veiled expression) of the <i>profanum vulgus</i> and the <i>ignavum
pecus</i>." Every one will understand how much truth there can be in a
doctrine which it is sought to uphold by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> defiant and dogmatic
rhetoric. Meanwhile, we must doubtless explain by the respect that this
language inspired, the really childish credulity with which Kant's
followers accepted the Categorical Imperative, and at once treated
it as a matter beyond dispute. The truth is that in this case any
objections raised to a theoretical assertion might easily be confounded
with moral obliquity; so that every one, although he had no very clear
idea in his own mind of the Categorical Imperative, yet preferred to
be silent, believing, as he did, in secret, that others were probably
better off, and had succeeded in evolving a clearer and more definite
mental picture of it. For no one likes to turn his conscience inside
out.</p>

<p>Thus in the Kantian School Practical Reason with its Categorical
Imperative appears more and more as a hyperphysical fact, as a Delphian
temple in the human soul, out of whose dark recesses proceed oracles
that infallibly declare not, alas! what will, but what ought to,
happen. This doctrine of Practical Reason, as a direct and immediate
fact, once it had been adopted, or rather introduced by artifice
combined with defiance, was unhappily later on extended also to
Theoretical Reason; and not unnaturally: for Kant himself had often
said that both are but one and the same Reason (<i>e.g</i>., Preface, p.
xii; R., p. 8). After it had been once admitted that in the domain of
the Practical there is a Reason which dictates <i>ex tripode</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_34" id="FNanchor_14_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_34" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> it was
an easy step to concede the same privilege to Theoretical Reason also,
closely related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> as the latter is to the former&mdash;indeed, consubstantial
with it. The one was thus pronounced to be just as immediate as the
other, the advantage of this being no less immense than obvious.</p>

<p>Then it was that all philosophasters and fancy-mongers, with J.H.
Jacobi&mdash;the denouncer of atheists&mdash;at their head, came crowding to
this postern which was so unexpectedly opened to them. They wanted
to bring their small wares to market, or at least to save what they
most valued of the old heirlooms which Kant's teaching threatened
to pulverise. As in the life of the individual a single youthful
mistake often ruins the whole career; so when Kant made that one
false assumption of a Practical Reason furnished with credentials
exclusively transcendent, and (like the supreme courts of appeal)
with powers of decision "without grounds," the result was that out of
the austere gravity of the Critical Philosophy was evolved a teaching
utterly heterogeneous to it. We hear of a Reason at first only dimly
"surmising," then clearly "comprehending" the "Supersensuous," and
at last endowed with a perfect "intellectual intuition" of it. Every
dreamer could now promulgate his mental freaks as the "absolute,"
<i>i.e.</i>, officially issued, deliverances, and revelations of this
Reason. Nor need we be surprised if the new privilege was fully taken
advantage of.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the origin of that philosophical method which appeared
immediately after Kant, and which is made up of clap-trap, of
mystification, of imposture, of deception, and of throwing dust in the
eyes. This era will be known one day in the History of Philosophy as
"The Period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> Dishonesty." For it was signalised by the disappearance
of the characteristic of honesty, of searching after truth in common
with the reader, which was well marked in the writings of all previous
philosophers. The philosophaster's object was not to instruct, but
to befool his hearers, as every page attests. At first Fichte and
Schelling shine as the heroes of this epoch; to be followed by the man
who is quite unworthy even of them, and greatly their inferior in point
of talent&mdash;I mean the stupid and clumsy charlatan Hegel. The Chorus is
composed of a mixed company of professors of philosophy, who in solemn
fashion discourse to their public about the Endless, the Absolute, and
many other matters of which they can know absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>As a stepping-stone to raise Reason to her prophetic throne a
wretched <i>jeu d'esprit</i> was actually dragged in, and made to serve.
It was asserted that, as the word <i>Vernunft</i> (Reason) comes from
<i>vernehmen</i> (to comprehend), therefore <i>Vernunft</i> means a capacity
to <b>comprehend</b> the so-called "Supersensuous," <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>Νεϕελοκοκκυγία</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_35" id="FNanchor_15_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_35" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> or Cloud-cuckoo-town. This pretty notion met
with boundless, approval, and for the space of thirty years was
constantly repeated in Germany with immense satisfaction; indeed, it
was made the foundation of philosophic manuals. And yet it is as clear
as noon-day that of course <i>Vernunft</i> (Reason) comes from. <i>vernehmen</i>
(to comprehend), but only because Reason makes man superior to animals,
so that he not only hears, but also <b>comprehends</b> (<i>vernimmt</i>)&mdash;by
no means,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> what is going on in Cloud-cuckoo-town&mdash;but what is said,
as by one reasonable person to another, the words spoken being
<b>comprehended</b> (<i>vernommen</i>) by the listener; and this capacity is
called <i>Reason</i> (<i>Vernunft</i>).</p>

<p>Such is the interpretation that all peoples, ages, and languages
have put on the word Reason. It has always been understood to mean
the possession of general, abstract, non-intuitive ideas, named
<b>concepts</b>, which are denoted and fixed by means of words. This
faculty alone it is which in reality gives to men their advantage
over animals. For these abstract ideas, or concepts, that is, mental
impressions formed of the sum of many separate things, are the
condition of <b>language</b> and through it of actual <b>thought</b>;
through which again they determine the consciousness not only of the
present (which animals also have), but of the past and the future as
such; whence it results that they are the <i>modulus</i>, so to say, of
clear recollection, of circumspection, of foresight, and of intention;
the constant factor in the evolution of systematic co-operation, of
the state, of trades, arts, sciences, religions, and philosophies,
in short, of everything that so sharply distinguishes human from
animal life. Beasts have only intuitive ideas, and therefore also
only intuitive motives; consequently the dependence of their volition
on motives is manifest. With man this dependence is no less a fact;
he, too (with due allowance for individual character), is affected
by motives under the strictest law of necessity. Only these are
for the most part not <i>intuitive</i> but <i>abstract</i> ideas, that is,
conceptions, or thoughts, which nevertheless are the result of previous
intuitions, hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> of external influences. This, however, gives him
a relative freedom&mdash;relative, that is, as compared with an animal.
For his action is not determined (as it is in all other creatures) by
the surroundings of the moment as intuitively perceived, but by the
thoughts he has derived from experience, or gained by instruction.
Consequently the motive, by which he, too, is necessarily swayed, is
not always at once obvious to the looker-on simultaneously with the
act; it lies concealed in the brain. It is this that lends to all his
movements, as well as to his conduct and work as a whole, a character
manifestly different from that observable in the habits of beasts. He
seems as though guided by finer, invisible threads; whence all his
acts bear the stamp of deliberation and premeditation, thus gaining
an appearance of independence, which sufficiently distinguishes them
from those of animals. All these great differences, however, spring
solely out of the capacity for <b>abstract ideas, concepts</b>. This
capacity is therefore the essential part of <b>Reason</b>, that is,
of the faculty peculiar to man, and it is called <i>το λόγιμον</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_36" id="FNanchor_16_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_36" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
<i>το λογιστικον,</i> <b>ratio, la ragione, il discorso, raison, reason,
discourse of reason</b>. If I were asked what the distinction is
between it and <b>Verstand</b>, <i>νοῡς</i>, <b>intellectus, entendement,
understanding</b>; I should reply thus: The latter is that capacity
for knowledge which animals also possess in varying degrees, and which
is seen in us at its highest development; in other words, it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
direct consciousness of the law of <b>Causality</b>&mdash;a consciousness
which precedes all experience, being constituted by the very form
of the understanding, whose essential nature is, in fact, therein
contained. On it depends in the first place the intuitive perception of
the external world; for the senses by themselves are only capable of
<b>impression</b>, a thing which is very far from being <b>intuitive
perception</b>; indeed, the former is nothing but the material of the
latter: <i>νοῡς ὁρᾷ, καὶ νοῡς ἀκούει, τ'ἄλλα κωϕὰ καὶ τυϕλά.</i> (The mind
sees, the mind hears; everything else is deaf and blind.) <b>Intuitive
perception</b> is the result of our directly referring the impressions
of the sense-organs to their cause, which, exactly because of this
act of the intelligence, presents itself as an <b>external object</b>
under the mode of intuition proper to us, <i>i.e.</i>, in <b>space</b>.
This is a proof that the Law of Causality is known to us <i>a priori</i>,
and does not arise from experience, since experience itself, inasmuch
as it presupposes intuitive perception, is only possible through the
same law. All the higher qualities of the intellect, all cleverness,
sagacity, penetration, acumen are directly proportional to the
exactness and fulness with which the workings of Causality in all its
relations are grasped; for all knowledge of the <b>connection</b>
of things, in the widest sense of the word, is based on the
comprehension of this law, and the clearness and accuracy with which
it is understood is the measure of one man's superiority to another
in <b>understanding</b>, shrewdness, cunning. On the other hand, the
epithet <b>reasonable</b> has at all times been applied to the man who
does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> not allow himself to be guided by intuitive impressions, but by
<b>thoughts</b> and <b>conceptions</b>, and who therefore always sets
to work logically after due reflection and forethought. Conduct of this
sort is everywhere known as <b>reasonable</b>. Not that this by any
means implies uprightness and love for one's fellows. On the contrary,
it is quite possible to act in the most reasonable way, that is,
according to conclusions scientifically deduced, and weighed with the
nicest exactitude; and yet to follow the most selfish, unjust, and even
iniquitons maxims. So that never before Kant did it occur to any one
to identify just, virtuous, and noble conduct with <b>reasonable</b>;
the two lines of behaviour have always been completely separated, and
kept apart. The one depends on the <b>kind of motivation</b>; the
other on the difference in fundamental principles. Only after Kant
(because he taught that virtue has its source in Pure Reason) did the
virtuous and the reasonable become one and the same thing, despite the
usage of these words which all languages have adopted&mdash;a usage which
is not fortuitous, but the work of universal, and therefore uniform,
human judgment. "Reasonable" and "vicious" are terms that go very
well together; indeed great, far-reaching crimes are only possible
from their union. Similarly, "unreasonable" and "noble-minded" are
often found associated; <i>e.g.</i>, if I give to-day to the needy man
what I shall myself require to-morrow more urgently than he; or,
if I am so far affected as to hand over to one in distress the sum
which my creditor is waiting for; and such cases could be multiplied
indefinitely.</p>

<p>We have seen that this exaltation of Reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> be the source of all
virtue rests on two assertions. First, as <b>Practical Reason</b>,
it is said to issue, like an oracle, peremptory Imperatives purely
<i>a priori.</i> Secondly, taken in connection with the false explanation
of <b>Theoretical Reason</b>, as given in the <i>Kritik der Reinen
Vernunft</i>, it is presented as a certain faculty essentially concerned
with the <b>Unconditioned</b>, as manifested in three alleged Ideas<a name="FNanchor_17_37" id="FNanchor_17_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_37" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
(the impossibility of which the intellect at the same time recognises
<i>a priori</i>). And we found that this position, as an <i>exemplar vitiis
imitabile</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18_38" id="FNanchor_18_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_38" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> led our muddy-headed philosophers, Jacobi at their
head, from bad to worse. They talked of <b>Reason</b> (<i>Vernunft</i>)
as directly comprehending (<i>vernehmend</i>) the "<b>Supersensuous</b>,"
and absurdly declared that it is a certain mental property which has
to do essentially with things transcending all experience, <i>i.e.</i>,
with metaphysics; and that it perceives directly and intuitively the
ultimate causes of all things, and of all Being, the Supersensuous,
the Absolute, the Divine, etc. Now, had it been wished to use Reason,
instead of deifying it, such assertions as these must long ago have
been met by the simple remark that, if man, by virtue of a special
organ, furnished by his Reason, for solving the riddle of the world,
possessed an innate metaphysics that only required development; in
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> case there would have to be just as complete agreement on
metaphysical matters as on the truths of arithmetic and geometry; and
this would make it totally impossible that there should exist on the
earth a large number of radically different religions, and a still
larger number of radically different systems of philosophy. Indeed,
we may rather suppose that, if any one were found to differ from the
rest in his religious or philosophical views, he would be at once
regarded as a subject for mental pathology. Nor would the following
plain reflection have failed to present itself. If we discovered a
species of apes which intentionally prepared instruments for fighting,
or building, or for any other purpose; we should immediately admit
that it was endowed with Reason. On the other hand, if we meet with
savages destitute of all metaphysics, or of all religion (and there are
such); it does not occur to us to deny them Reason on that account.
The Reason that <b>proves</b> its pretended supersensuous knowledge
was duly brought back to bounds by Kant's critique; but Jacobi's
wonderful Reason, that directly <b>comprehends</b> the supersensuous,
he must indeed have thought <b>beneath</b> all criticism. Meanwhile, a
certain imperious and oracular Reason of the same kind is still, at the
Universities, fastened on the shoulders of our innocent youth.</p>

<h4><a id="NOTE_b"></a>NOTE.</h4>

<p>If we wish to reach the real origin of this hypothesis of Practical
Reason, we must trace its descent a little further back. We shall find
that it is derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> from a doctrine, which Kant totally confuted,
but which nevertheless, in this connection, lies secretly (indeed
he himself is not aware of it) at the root of his assumption of a
Practical Reason with its Imperatives and its Autonomy&mdash;a reminiscence
of a former mode of thought. I mean the so-called Rational Psychology,
according to which man is composed of two entirely heterogeneous
substances&mdash;the material body, and the immaterial soul. Plato was
the first to formulate this dogma, and he endeavoured to prove it
as an objective truth. But it was Descartes who, by working it out
with scientific exactness, perfectly developed and completed it. And
this is just what brought its fallacy to light, as demonstrated by
Spinoza, Locke, and Kant successively. It was demonstrated by Spinoza;
because his philosophy consists chiefly in the refutation of his
master's twofold dualism, and because he entirely and expressly denied
the two Substances of Descartes, and took as his main principle the
following proposition: "<i>Substantia cogitans et substantia externa
una eademque est substantia, quae jam sub hoc, jam sub illo attribute
comprehenditur.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_19_39" id="FNanchor_19_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_39" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It was demonstrated by Locke; for he combated
the theory of innate ideas, derived all knowledge from the sensuous,
and taught that it is not impossible that Matter should think. And
lastly, it was demonstrated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> Kant, in his <i>Kritik der Rationalen
Psychologie</i>, as given in the first edition. Leibnitz and Wolff were
the champions on the bad side; and this brought Leibnitz the undeserved
honour of being compared to the great Plato, who was really so unlike
him.</p>

<p>But to enter into details here would be out of place. According to
this Rational Psychology, the soul was originally and in its essence
a <b>perceiving</b> substance, and only as a consequence thereof did
it become possessed of volition. According as it carried on these two
modes of its activity, Perception and Volition, conjoined with the
body, or incorporeal, and entirely <i>per se</i>, so it was endowed with a
lower or higher faculty of perception, and of volition in like kind.
In its higher faculty the immaterial soul was active solely by itself,
and without co-operation of the body. In this case it was <i>intellectus
purus</i>, being composed of concepts, belonging exclusively to itself,
and of the corresponding acts of will, both of which were absolutely
spiritual, and had nothing sensuous about them&mdash;the sensuous being
derived from the body.<a name="FNanchor_20_40" id="FNanchor_20_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_40" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> So that it perceived nothing else but pure
Abstracts, Universals, innate conceptions, <i>aeternae veritates</i>,
etc.; wherefore also its volition was entirely controlled by purely
spiritual ideas like these. On the other hand, the soul's <b>lower</b>
faculty of Perception and Volition was the result of its working in
concert and close union with the various organs of the body, whereby a
prejudicial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> effect was produced on its an mixed spiritual activity.
Here, <i>i.e.</i>, to this <b>lower</b> faculty, was supposed to belong
every <b>intuitive</b> perception, which consequently would have
to be obscure and confused, while the <b>abstract</b>, formed by
separating from objects their qualities, would be clear! The will,
which was determined by preceptions thus sensuously conditioned, formed
the lower Volition, and it was for the most part bad; for its acts
were guided by the impulse of the senses; while the other will (the
higher) was untrammelled, was guided by Pure Reason, and appertained
only to the immaterial soul. This doctrine of the Cartesians has been
best expounded by De la Forge, in his <i>Tractatus de Mente Humana</i>,
where in chap. 23 we read:<a name="FNanchor_21_41" id="FNanchor_21_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_41" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> <i>Non nisi eadem voluntas est, quae
appellatur appetitus sensitivus, quando excitatur per judicia, quae
formantur consequenter ad perceptiones sensuum; et quae appetitus
rationalis nominatur, cum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> mens judicia format de propriis suis ideis,
independenter a cogitationibus sensuum confusis, quae inclinationum
ejus sunt causae.... Id, quod occasionem dedit, ut duae istae diversae
voluntatis propensiones pro duobus diversis appetitibus sumerentur,
est, quod saepissime unus alteri opponatur, quia propositum, quod mens
superaedificat propriis suis perceptionibus, non semper consentit cum
cogitationibus, quae menti a corporis dispositione suggeruntur, per
quam saepe obligatur ad aliquid volendum, dum ratio ejus earn aliud
optare facit.</i></p>

<p>Out of the dim reminiscence of such views there finally arose Kant's
doctrine of the Autonomy of the Will, which, as the mouth-piece of
Pure, Practical Reason, lays down the law for all rational beings as
such, and recognises nothing but <b>formal</b> motives, as opposed
to <b>material</b>; the latter determining only the lower faculty of
desires, to which the higher is hostile. For the rest, this whole
theory, which was not really systematically set forth till the time
of Descartes, is nevertheless to be found as far back as Aristotle.
In his <i>De Anima</i> I. 1, it is sufficiently clearly stated; while
Plato in the <i>Phaedo</i> (pp. 188 and 189, edit. Bipont.) had already
paved the way, with no uncertain hints. After being elaborated to
great perfection by the Cartesian doctrine, we find it a hundred
years later waxed bold and strong, and occupying the foremost place;
but precisely for this reason forced to reveal its true nature. An
excellent <i>résumé</i> of the view which then prevailed is presented in
Muratori's <i>Della Forza della Fantasia,</i> chaps. 1-4 and 13. In this
work the imagination is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> regarded as a purely material, corporeal organ
of the brain (the lower faculty of perception), its function being to
intuitively apprehend the external world on the data of the senses;
and nought remains for the immaterial soul but thinking, reflecting,
and determining. It must have been felt how obviously this position
involves the whole subject in doubt. For if Matter is capable of the
intuitive apprehension of the world in all its complexity, it is
inconceivable that it should not also be capable of abstracting this
intuition; wherefrom everything else would follow. Abstraction is of
course nothing else than an elimination of the qualities attaching to
things which are not necessary for general purposes, in other words,
the individual and special differences. For instance, if I disregard,
or abstract, that which is peculiar to the sheep, ox, stag, camel,
etc., I reach the conception of ruminants. By this operation the ideas
lose their intuitiveness, and as merely abstract, non-intuitive notions
or concepts, they require words to fix them in the consciousness, and
allow of their being adequately handled. All this shows that Kant
was still under the influence of the after-effect of that old-time
doctrine, when he propounded his Practical Reason with its Imperatives.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_Vb" id="CHAPTER_Vb">CHAPTER V.</a></h4>

<h3>ON THE LEADING PRINCIPLE OF THE KANTIAN ETHICS.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>After having tested in the preceding chapter the actual basis of Kant's
Ethics, I now turn to that which rests on it&mdash;his <b>leading principle
of Morals</b>. The latter is very closely connected with the former;
indeed, in a certain sense, they both grew up together. We have seen
that the formula expressing the principle reads as follows: "Act only
in accordance with that precept which you can also wish should be a
general law for all rational beings." It is a strange proceeding for a
man, who <i>ex hypothesi</i> is seeking a law to determine what he should
do, and what he should leave undone, to be instructed first to search
for one fit to regulate the conduct of all possible rational beings;
but we will pass over that. It is sufficient only to notice the fact
that in the above guiding rule, as put forth by Kant, we have obviously
not reached the moral law itself, but only a finger-post, or indication
where it is to be looked for. The money, so to say, is not yet paid
down, but we hold a safe draft for it. And who, then, is the cashier?
To say the truth at once: a paymaster in this connection surely very
unexpected, being neither more nor less than <b>Egoism</b>, as I shall
now demonstrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>The precept, it is said, which <b>I can wish</b> were the guide of all
men's conduct, is itself the real moral principle. That which <b>I can
wish</b> is the hinge on which the given direction turns. But what can
I truly wish, and what not? Clearly, in order to determine what I can
wish in the matter under discussion, I require yet another criterion;
for without such I could never find the key to the instruction which
comes to me like a sealed order. Where, then, is this criterion to
be discovered? Certainly nowhere else but in my Egoism, which is the
nearest, ever ready, original, and living standard of all volition, and
which has at any rate the <i>jus primi occupantis</i> before every moral
principle. The direction for finding the real moral law, which is
contained in the Kantian rule, rests, as a matter of fact, on the tacit
assumption that I can only wish for that which is most to my advantage.
Now because, in framing a precept to be generally followed, I cannot
regard myself as always active, but must contemplate my playing a
<b>passive</b> part <i>eventualiter</i> and at times; therefore from this
point of view my <b>egoism</b> decides for justice and loving-kindness;
not from any wish to <b>practise</b> these virtues, but because it
desires to <b>experience</b> them. We are reminded of the miser, who,
after listening to a sermon on beneficence, exclaims:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
"<i>Wie gründlich ausgeführt, wie schön!</i>&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Fast möcht' ich betteln gehn."</i></span><br />
(How well thought out, how excellent!&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Almost I'd like to beg.)</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is the indispensable key to the direction in which Kant's leading
principle of Ethics is embedded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> nor can he help supplying it
himself. Only he refrains from doing so at the moment of propounding
his precept, lest we should feel shocked. It is found further on in
the text, at a decent distance, so as to prevent the fact at once
leaping to light, that here, after all, in spite of his grand <i>a
priori</i> edifice, <b>Egoism</b> is sitting on the judge's seat, scales
in hand. Moreover, it does not occur, till after he has decided,
from the point of view of the <i>eventualiter</i> passive side, that this
position holds good for the active <i>rôle</i> as well. Thus, on p. 19 (R.,
p. 24) we read: "That I could not <b>wish</b> for a general law to
establish lying, because people would no longer believe me, or else
pay me back in the <b>same coin</b>." Again on p. 55 (R., p. 49): "The
universality of a law to the effect that every one could promise what
he likes, without any intention of keeping his word, would make the
promise itself, together with the object in view, whatever that might
be, impossible; for no one would <b>believe</b> it." On p. 56 (R., p.
50), in connection with the maxim of <b>hard-heartedness</b>, we find
the following: "A will, which should determine this, would contradict
itself; for cases can occur, in which a man needs the love and sympathy
of others, and in which he, by virtue of such a natural law, evolved
from his own will, would deprive himself of all hope of the help,
which he desires." Similarly in the <i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i>
(Part I., vol. i., chap. 2, p. 123; R., p. 192): "If every one were to
regard others' distress with total indifference, and you were to belong
to such an order of things; would you be there with the concurrence
of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> will?" <i>Quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam</i>!<a name="FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_42" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
one could reply. These passages sufficiently show in what sense the
phrase, "to be able to wish," in Kant's formula is to be understood.
But it is in the <i>Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Tugendlehre</i>, that
this real nature of his ethical principle is most clearly stated. In
§ 30 we read: "For every one wishes to be helped. If, however, a man
were to give utterance to his rule of unwillingness to help others,
all people would be justified in refusing him assistance. Thus this
rule of selfishness contradicts itself." <b>Would be justified</b>,
he says, <b>would be justified</b>! Here, then, it is declared, as
explicitly as anything can be, that moral obligation rests solely and
entirely on presupposed <b>reciprocity</b>; consequently it is utterly
selfish, and only admits of being interpreted by egoism, which, under
the condition of <b>reciprocity</b>, knows how to make a compromise
cleverly enough. Such a course would be quite in place if it were a
question of laying down the fundamentals of state-organisation, but
not, when we come to construct those of ethics. In the <i>Grundlegung</i>,
p. 81 (R., p. 67), the following sentence occurs: "The principle of
always acting in accordance with that precept which you can also wish
were universally established as law&mdash;this is the only condition under
which a man's will can never be in antagonism with itself." From what
has been said above, it will be apparent that the true meaning of the
word "antagonism" may be thus explained:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> if a man should sanction the
precept of injustice and hard-heartedness, he would subsequently, in
the event of his playing a <b>passive</b> part, recall it, and so his
will would <b>contradict</b> itself.</p>

<p>From this analysis it is abundantly clear that Kant's famous leading
principle is not&mdash;as he maintains with tireless repetition&mdash;a
<b>categorical</b>, but in reality a <b>hypothetical</b> Imperative;
because it tacitly presupposes the condition that the law to be
established for what I do&mdash;inasmuch as I make it universal&mdash;shall
also be a law for what is done to me; and because I, under this
condition, as the <i>eventualiter</i> non-active party, <b>cannot</b>
possibly <b>wish</b> for injustice and hard-heartedness. But if I
strike out this proviso, and, trusting perhaps to my surpassing
strength of mind and body, think of myself as always <b>active</b>,
and never <b>passive</b>; then, in choosing the precept which is to
be universally valid, if there exists no basis for ethics other than
Kant's, I can perfectly well wish that injustice and hard-heartedness
should be the general rule, and consequently order the world</p>

</p>

<p>In the foregoing chapter we showed that the Kantian leading principle
of Ethics is devoid of all real foundation. It is now clear that to
this singular defect must be added, notwithstanding Kant's express
assertion to the contrary, its concealed hypothetical nature, whereby
its basis turns out to be nothing else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> than Egoism, the latter being
the secret interpreter of the direction which it contains. Furthermore,
regarding it solely as a formula, we find that it is only a
periphrasis, an obscure and disguised mode of expressing the well-known
rule: <i>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris</i> (do not to another
what you are unwilling should be done to yourself); if, that is, by
omitting the <i>non</i> and <i>ne</i>, we remove the limitation, and include the
duties taught by love as well as those prescribed by law. For it is
obvious that this is the only precept which I can wish should regulate
the conduct of all men (speaking, of course, from the point of view of
the possibly <b>passive part</b> I may play, where my <b>Egoism</b>
is touched). This rule, <i>Quod tibi fieri, etc.</i>, is, however, in its
turn, merely a circumlocution for, or, if it be preferred, a premise
of, the proposition which I have laid down as the simplest and purest
definition of the conduct required by the common consent of all ethical
systems; namely, <i>Neminem laede, immo omnes, quantum potes, juva</i> (do
harm to no one; but rather help all people, as far as lies in your
power). The true and real substance of Morals is this, and never can
be anything else. But on what is it based? What is it that lends force
to this command? This is the old and difficult problem with which man
is still to-day confronted. For, on the other side, we hear Egoism
crying with a loud voice: <i>Neminem juva, immo omnes, si forte conducit,
laede</i> (help nobody, but rather injure all people, if it brings you any
advantage); nay more, Malice gives us the variant: <i>Immo omnes, quantum
potes, laede</i> (but rather injure all people as far as you can). To
bring into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> lists a combatant equal, or rather superior to Egoism
and Malice combined&mdash;this is the task of all Ethics. <i>Heic Rhodus, heic
salta!</i><a name="FNanchor_2_43" id="FNanchor_2_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_43" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The division of human duty into two classes has long been recognised,
and no doubt owes its origin to the nature of morality itself. We
have. (1) the duties ordained by law (otherwise called the&mdash;perfect,
obligatory, narrower duties), and (2) those prescribed by virtue
(otherwise called imperfect, wider, meritorious, or, preferably, the
duties taught by love). On p. 57 (R., p. 60) we find Kant desiring
to give a further confirmation to the moral principle, which he
propounded, by undertaking to derive this classification from it. But
the attempt turns out to be so forced, and so obviously bad, that
it only testifies in the strongest way against the soundness of his
position. For, according to him, the duties laid down by statutes rest
on a precept, the contrary of which, taken as a general natural law, is
declared to be quite <b>unthinkable</b> without contradiction; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the duties inculcated by virtue are made to depend on a maxim, the
opposite of which can (he says) be conceived as a general natural law,
but cannot possibly be wished for. I beg the reader to reflect that the
rule of injustice, the reign of might instead of right, which in the
Kantian view is not even thinkable as a natural law, is in reality,
and in point of fact, the dominant order of things not only in the
animal kingdom, but among men as well. It is true that an attempt has
been made among civilised peoples to obviate its injurious effects by
means of all the machinery of state government; but as soon as this,
wherever, or of whatever kind, it be, is suspended or eluded, the
natural law immediately resumes its sway. Indeed between nation and
nation it never ceases to prevail; the customary jargon about justice
is well known to be nothing but diplomacy's official style; the real
arbiter is brute force. On the other hand, genuine, <i>i.e.</i>, voluntary,
acts of justice, do occur beyond all doubt, but always only as
exceptions to the rule. Furthermore: wishing to give instances by way
of introducing the above-mentioned classification, Kant establishes the
duties prescribed by law first (p. 53; R., p. 48) through the so-called
duty towards oneself,&mdash;the duty of not ending one's life voluntarily,
if the pain outweigh the pleasure. Accordingly, the rule of suicide is
held to be not even <b>thinkable</b> as a general natural law. I, on
the contrary, maintain that, since here there can be no intervention
of state control, it is exactly this rule which is proved to be an
actually existing, unchecked natural law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> For it is absolutely certain
(as daily experience attests) that men in the vast majority of cases
turn to self-destruction directly the gigantic strength of the innate
instinct of self-preservation is distinctly overpowered by great
suffering. To suppose that there is any thought whatever that can have
a deferring effect, after the fear of death, which is so strong and
so closely bound up with the nature of every living thing, has shown
itself powerless; in other words, to suppose that there is a thought
still mightier than this fear&mdash;is a daring assumption, all the more so,
when we see, that it is one which is so difficult to discover that the
moralists are not yet able to determine it with precision. In any case,
it is certain that arguments against suicide of the sort put forward
by Kant in this connection (p. 53: R., p. 48, and p. 67; R., p. 57)
have never hitherto restrained any one tired of life even for a moment.
Thus a natural law, which incontestably exists, and is operative every
day, is declared by Kant to be simply <b>unthinkable</b> without
contradiction, and all for the sake of making his Moral Principle the
basis of the classification of duties! At this point it is, I confess,
not without satisfaction that I look forward to the groundwork which I
shall give to Ethics in the sequel. From it the division of Duty into
what is prescribed by law, and what is taught by love, or, better,
into justice and loving-kindness, results quite naturally though a
principle of separation which arises from the nature of the subject,
and which entirely of itself draws a sharp line of demarkation; so that
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> foundation of Morals, which I shall present, has in fact ready to
hand that confirmation, to which Kant, with a view to support his own
position, lays a completely groundless claim.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_VIb" id="CHAPTER_VIb">CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<h3>ON THE DERIVED FORMS OF THE LEADING PRINCIPLE OF THE KANTIAN ETHICS.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>It is well known that Kant put the leading principle of his Ethics
into another quite different shape, in which it is expressed directly;
the first being indirect, indeed nothing more than an indication as
to how the principle is to be sought for. Beginning at p. 63 (R.,
p. 55), he prepares the way for his second formula by means of very
strange, ambiguous, not to say distorted,<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> definitions of the
conceptions <b>End</b> and <b>Means</b>, which may be much more simply
and correctly denoted thus: an <b>End</b> is the direct motive of an
act of the Will, a <b>Means</b> the indirect: <i>simplex sigillum veri</i>
(simplicity is the seal of truth). Kant, however, slips through his
wonderful enunciations to the statement: "<b>Man</b>, indeed every
rational being, exists <b>as an end in himself</b>." On this I must
remark that "<b>to exist as an end in oneself</b>" is an unthinkable
expression, a <i>contradictio in adjecto</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_45" id="FNanchor_2_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_45" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> To be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> end means to
be an object of volition. Every end can only exist in relation to a
will, whose end, <i>i.e.</i>, (as above stated), whose direct motive it is.
Only thus can the idea, "end" have any sense, which is lost as soon as
such connection is broken. But this relation, which is essential to
the thing, necessarily excludes every "in itself." "End in oneself"
is exactly like saying: "Friend in oneself;&mdash;enemy in oneself;&mdash;uncle
in oneself;&mdash;north or east in itself;&mdash;above or below in itself;"
and so on. At bottom the "end in itself" is in the same case as the
"absolute ought"; the same thought&mdash;the theological&mdash;secretly, indeed,
unconsciously lies at the root of each as its condition. Nor is the
"absolute worth," which is supposed to be attached to this alleged,
though unthinkable, "end in itself," at all better circumstanced.
It also must be characterised, without pity, as a <i>contradictio in
adjecto</i>. Every "worth" is a valuation by comparison, and its bearing
is necessarily twofold. First, it is <b>relative</b>, since it exists
for some one; and secondly, it is <b>comparative</b>, as being compared
with something else, and estimated accordingly. Severed from these two
conditions, the conception, "worth," loses all sense and meaning, and
so obviously, that further demonstration is needless. But more: just
as the phrases "end in itself" and "absolute worth" outrage logic, so
true morality is outraged by the statement on p. 65 (R., p. 56), that
irrational beings (that is, animals) are <b>things</b>, and should
therefore be treated simply as <b>means</b>, which are not at the same
time ends. In harmony with this, it is expressly declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> in the
<i>Metaphysische Anfanggründe der Tugendlehre,</i> § 16: "A man can have no
duties towards any being, except towards his fellow-men;" and then, §
17, we read: "To treat animals cruelly runs counter to the duty of man
<b>towards himself</b>; because it deadens the feeling of sympathy for
them in their sufferings, and thus weakens a natural tendency which
is very serviceable to morality in relation to <b>other men</b>." So
one is only to have compassion on animals for the sake of practice,
and they are as it were the pathological phantom on which to train
one's sympathy with men! In common with the whole of Asia that is not
tainted by Islâm (which is tantamount to Judaism), I regard such tenets
as odious and revolting. Here, once again, we see withal how entirely
this philosophical morality, which is, as explained above, only a
theological one in disguise, depends in reality on the biblical Ethics.
Thus, because Christian morals leave animals out of consideration
(of which more later on); therefore in philosophical morals they
are of course at once outlawed; they are merely "things," simply
<b>means</b> to ends of any sort; and so they are good for vivisection,
for deer-stalking, bull-fights, horse-races, etc., and they may be
whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy quarry carts.
Shame on such a morality which is worthy of Pariahs, Chandalas and
Mlechchas<a name="FNanchor_3_46" id="FNanchor_3_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_46" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; which fails to recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> the Eternal Reality immanent
in everything that has life, and shining forth with inscrutable
significance from all eyes that see the sun! This is a morality which
knows and values only the precious species that gave it birth; whose
characteristic&mdash;<b>reason</b>&mdash;it makes the condition under which a
being may be an object of moral regard.</p>

<p>By this rough path, then,&mdash;indeed, <i>per fas et nefas</i> (by fair means
and by foul), Kant reaches the second form in which he expresses the
fundamental principle of his Ethics: "Act in such a way that you at
all times treat mankind, as much in your own person, as in the person
of every one else, not only as a Means, but also as an End." Such a
statement is a very artificial and roundabout way of saying: "Do not
consider yourself alone, but others also;" this in turn is a paraphrase
for: <i>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris</i> (do not to another
what you are unwilling should be done to yourself); and the latter,
as I have said, contains nothing but the premises to the conclusion,
which is the true and final goal of all morals and of all moralising;
<i>Neminem laede, immo omnes, quantum potes juva</i> (do harm to no one;
but rather help all people as far as lies in your power). Like all
beautiful things, this proposition looks best unveiled. Be it only
observed that the alleged duties towards oneself are dragged into this
second Kantian edict intentionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> and not without difficulty. Some
place of course had to be found for them.<a name="FNanchor_4_47" id="FNanchor_4_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_47" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Another objection that could be raised against the formula is that the
malefactor condemned to be executed is treated merely as an instrument,
and not as an end, and this with perfectly good reason; for he is
the indispensable means of upholding the terror of the law by its
fulfilment, and of thus accomplishing the law's end&mdash;the repression of
crime.</p>

<p>But if this second definition helps nothing towards laying a foundation
for Ethics, if it cannot even pass muster as its leading principle,
that is, as an adequate and direct summary of ethical precepts; it
has nevertheless the merit of containing a fine <i>aperçu</i> of moral
psychology, for it marks <b>egoism</b> by an exceedingly characteristic
token, which is quite worth while being here more closely considered.
This <b>egoism</b>, then, of which each of us is full, and to conceal
which, as our <i>partie honteuse</i>, we have invented <b>politeness</b>,
is perpetually peering through every veil cast over it, and may
especially be detected in the fact that our dealings with all those,
who come across our path, are directed by the one object of trying
to find, before everything else, and as if by instinct, a possible
<b>means</b> to any of the numerous <b>ends</b> with which we are
always engrossed. When we make a new acquaintance, our first thought,
as a rule, is whether the man can be useful to us in some way. If he
can do <b>nothing</b> for our benefit, then as soon as we are convinced
of this, he himself generally becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> nothing to us. To seek in all
other people a possible means to our ends, in other words, to make
them our instruments, is almost part of the very nature of human
eyes; and whether the instrument will have to suffer more or less
in the using, is a thought which comes much later, sometimes not at
all. That we assume others to be similarly disposed is shown in many
ways; <i>e.g.</i>, by the fact that, when we ask any one for information
or advice, we lose all confidence in his words directly we discover
that he may have some <b>interest</b> in the matter, however small or
remote. For then we immediately take for granted that he will make us
a means to his ends, and hence give his advice not in accordance with
his <b>discernment</b>, but with his <b>desire</b>, and this, no matter
how exact the former may be, or how little the latter seem involved;
since we know only too well that a cubic inch of desire weighs much
more than a cubic yard of discernment. Conversely, when we ask in such
cases: "What ought I to do?" as a rule, nothing else will occur to our
counsellor, but how we should shape our action to suit his own ends;
and to this effect he will give his reply immediately, and as it were
mechanically, without so much as bestowing a thought on our ends;
because it is his Will that directly dictates the answer, or ever the
question can come before the bar of his real judgment. Hence he tries
to mould our conduct to his own benefit, without even being conscious
of it, and while he supposes that he is speaking out of the abundance
of his discernment, in reality he is nothing but the mouth-piece of
his own desire; indeed, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> self-deception may lead him so far as to
utter lies, without being aware of it. So greatly does the influence of
the Will preponderate that of the Intelligence. Consequently, it is not
the testimony of our own consciousness, but rather, for the most part,
that of our interest, which avails to determine whether our language be
in accordance with what we discern, or what we desire. To take another
case. Let us suppose that a man pursued by enemies and in danger of
life, meets a pedlar and inquires for some by-way of escape; it may
happen that the latter will answer him by the question: "Do you need
any of my wares?" It is not of course meant that matters are always
like this. On the contrary, many a man is found to show a direct and
real participation in another's weal and woe, or (in Kant's language)
to regard him as an end and not as a means. How far it seems natural,
or the reverse, to each one to treat his neighbour for once in the way
as an end, instead of (as usual) a means,&mdash;this is the criterion of the
great ethical difference existing between character and character; and
that on which the mental attitude of sympathy rests in the last resort
will be the true basis of Ethics, and will form the subject of the
third part of this Essay.</p>

<p>Thus, in his second formula, Kant distinguishes Egoism and its opposite
by a very characteristic trait; and this point of merit I have all the
more gladly brought out into strong light and illustrated, because in
other respects there is little in the groundwork of his Ethics that I
can admit.</p>

<p>The third and last form in which Kant put forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> his Moral Principle
is the <b>Autonomy</b> of the Will: "The Will of every rational
being is universally legislative for all rational beings." This of
course follows from the first form. As a consequence of the third,
however, we are asked to believe (see p. 71; R., p. 60) that the
specific characteristic of the Categorical Imperative lies in the
<b>renunciation of all interest</b> by the Will when acting from a
sense of duty. All previous moral principles had thus (he says) broken
down, "because the latter invariably attributed to human actions at
bottom a certain interest, whether originating in compulsion, or
in pleasurable attraction&mdash;an interest which might be one's own,
or another's" (p. 73; R., p. 62). (<b>Another's</b>: let this be
particularly noticed.) "Whereas a universally legislative Will must
prescribe actions which are <b>not</b> based on any <b>interest</b> at
all, but solely on a feeling of duty." I beg the reader to think what
this really means. As a matter of fact, nothing less than volition
without motive, in other words, effect without cause. Interest and
Motive are interchangeable ideas; what is interest but <i>quod mea
interest</i>, that which is of importance to me? And is not this, in one
word, whatever stirs and sets in motion my Will? Consequently, what is
an interest other than the working of a motive upon the Will? Therefore
where a motive moves the Will, there the latter has an interest; but
where the Will is affected by no motive, there in truth it can be as
little active, as a stone is able to leave its place without being
pushed or pulled. No educated person will require any demonstration of
this. It follows that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> action, inasmuch as it necessarily must
have a motive, necessarily also presupposes an interest. Kant, however,
propounds a second entirely new class of actions which are performed
without any interest, <i>i.e.</i>, without motive. And these actions
are&mdash;all deeds of justice and loving-kindness! It will be seen that
this monstrous assumption, to be refuted, needed only to be reduced to
its real meaning, which was concealed through the word "interest" being
trifled with. Meanwhile Kant celebrates (p. 74 sqq.; R., p. 62) the
triumph of his Autonomy of the Will by setting up a moral Utopia called
the Kingdom of Ends, which is peopled with nothing but <b>rational
beings</b> <i>in abstracto</i>. These, one and all, are always willing,
without willing any actual <b>thing</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, without interest):
the only thing that they will is that they may all perpetually will in
accordance with one maxim (<i>i.e.</i>, Autonomy). <i>Difficile est satiram
non scribere</i><a name="FNanchor_5_48" id="FNanchor_5_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_48" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (it is difficult to refrain from writing a satire).</p>

<p>But there is something else to which Kant is led by his autonomy of
the will; and it involves more serious consequences than the little
innocent Kingdom of Ends, which is perfectly harmless and may be left
in peace. I mean the conception of <b>human dignity</b>. Now this
"dignity" is made to rest solely on man's autonomy, and to lie in the
fact that the law which he ought to obey is his own work, his relation
to it thus being the same as that of the subjects of a constitutional
government to their statutes. As an ornamental finish to the Kantian
system of morals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> such a theory might after all be passed over. Only
this expression "<b>Human Dignity</b>," once it was uttered by Kant,
became the shibboleth of all perplexed and empty-headed moralists. For
behind that imposing formula they concealed their lack, not to say,
of a real ethical basis, but of any basis at all which was possessed
of an intelligible meaning; supposing cleverly enough that their
readers would be so pleased to see themselves invested with such a
"dignity" that they would be quite satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_6_49" id="FNanchor_6_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_49" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Let us, however,
look at this conception a little more carefully, and submit it to
the test of reality. Kant (p. 79; R., p. 66) defines <b>dignity</b>
as "an unconditioned, incomparable value." This is an explanation
which makes such an effect by its magnificent sound that one does
not readily summon up courage to examine it at close quarters; else
we should find that it too is nothing but a hollow hyperbole, within
which there lurks like a gnawing worm, the <i>contradictio in adjecto</i>.
Every value is the estimation of one thing compared with another; it
is thus a conception of comparison, and consequently relative; and
this relativity is precisely that which forms the essence of the idea.
According to Diogenes Laertius (Book VII., chap. 106),<a name="FNanchor_7_50" id="FNanchor_7_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_50" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> this was
already correctly taught by the Stoics. He says: <i>τὴn δὲ ἀξίαν εἶναι<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
ἀμοιβὴν δοκιμάστου, ἢν ἂν ὁ ἔμπειρος τῶν Πραγμάτων τάξῃ ὅμοιον εἐπεῑν,
ἀμείβεσθαι πυροὺς πρὸς τὰς σὺν ἡμιονô κριθάς.</i><a name="FNanchor_8_51" id="FNanchor_8_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_51" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> An <b>incomparable,
unconditioned, absolute value</b>, such as "dignity" is declared by
Kant to be, is thus, like so much else in Philosophy, the statement in
words of a thought which is really unthinkable; just as much as "the
highest number," or "the greatest space."</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"<i>Doch eben wo Begriffe fehlen</i>,</span><br />
<i>Da stellt ein <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">WORT</span> zu rechter Zeit sich ein.</i>"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">(But where conceptions fail,</span><br />
Just there a <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">WORD</span> comes in to fill the blank.)<br />
</p>

<p>So it was with this expression, "<b>Human Dignity</b>." A most
acceptable phrase was brought into currency. Thereon every system of
Morals, that was spun out through all classes of duty, and all forms of
casuistry, found a broad basis; from which serene elevation it could
comfortably go on preaching.</p>

<p>At the end of his exposition (p. 124; E., p. 97), Kant says: "But how
it is that <b>Pure Reason</b> without other motives, that may have
their derivation elsewhere, can by itself be <b>practical</b>; that is,
how, without there being any object for the Will to take an antecedent
interest in, the simple principle of the universal validity of all the
precepts of Pure Reason, as laws, can of itself provide a motive and
bring about an interest which may be called purely moral; or, in other
words, how it is that Pure Reason can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> be practical;&mdash;to explain this
problem, all human reason is inadequate, and all trouble and work spent
on it are vain." Now it should be remembered that, if any one asserts
the existence of a thing which cannot even be conceived as possible, it
is incumbent on him to prove that it is an actual reality; whereas the
Categorical Imperative of Practical Reason is expressly not put forward
as a fact of consciousness, nor otherwise founded on experience. Rather
are we frequently cautioned not to attempt to explain it by having
recourse to empirical anthropology. (Cf. <i>e.g.</i>, p. vi. of the preface;
R., p. 5; and pp. 59, 60; R., p. 52). Moreover, we are repeatedly
(<i>e.g.</i>, p. 48; R., p. 44) assured "that no instance can show, and
consequently there can be no empirical proof, that an Imperative of
this sort exists everywhere." And further, on p. 49 (R., p. 45), we
read, "that the reality of the Categorical Imperative is not a fact of
experience." Now if we put all this together, we can hardly avoid the
suspicion that Kant is jesting at his readers' expense. But although
this practice may be allowed by the present philosophical public of
Germany, and seem good in their eyes, yet in Kant's time it was not so
much in vogue; and besides, Ethics, then, as always, was precisely the
subject that least of all could lend itself to jokes. Hence we must
continue to hold the conviction that what can neither be conceived as
possible, nor proved as actual, is destitute of all credentials to
attest its existence. And if, by a strong effort of the imagination,
we try to picture to ourselves a man, possessed, as it were, by a
<i>daemon</i>, in the form of an <b>absolute Ought</b>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> that speaks only in
Categorical Imperatives, and, confronting his wishes and inclinations,
claims to be the perpetual controller of his actions; in this figure
we see no true portrait of human nature, or of our inner life; what we
<b>do</b> discern is an artificial substitute for theological Morals,
to which it stands in the same relation as a wooden leg to a living one.</p>

<p>Our conclusion, therefore, is, that the Kantian Ethics, like all
anterior systems, is devoid of any sure foundation. As I showed at
the outset, in my examination of its <b>imperative Form</b>, the
structure is at bottom nothing but an inversion of theological Morals,
cloaked in very abstract formulae of an apparently <i>a priori</i> origin.
That this disguise was most artificial and unrecognisable is the more
certain, from the fact that Kant, in all good faith, was actually
himself deceived by it, and really believed that he could establish,
independently of all theology, and on the basis of pure intelligence <i>a
priori</i>, those conceptions of the Law and of the hests of Duty, which
obviously have no meaning except in <b>theological Ethics</b>; whereas
I have sufficiently proved that with him they are destitute of all real
foundation, and float loosely in mid air. However, the mask at length
falls away in his own workshop, and theological Ethics stands forth
unveiled, as witness his doctrine of the Highest Good, the Postulates
of Practical Reason; and lastly, his Moral Theology. But this
revelation freed neither Kant nor the public from their illusion as to
the real state of things; on the contrary, both he and they rejoiced to
see all those precepts, which hitherto had been sanctioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> by Faith,
now ratified and established by Ethics (although only <i>idealiter</i>, and
for practical purposes). The truth is that they, in all sincerity, put
the effect for the cause, and the cause for the effect, inasmuch as
they failed to perceive that at the root of this system of Morals there
lay, as absolutely necessary assumptions, however tacit and concealed,
all the alleged consequences that had been drawn from it.</p>

<p>At the end of this severe investigation, which must also have been
tiring to my readers, perhaps I may be allowed, by way of diversion, to
make a jesting, indeed frivolous comparison. I would liken Kant, in his
self-mystification, to a man who at a ball has been flirting the whole
evening with a masked beauty, in hopes of making a conquest; till at
last, throwing off her disguise, she reveals herself&mdash;as his wife.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_VIIb" id="CHAPTER_VIIb">CHAPTER VII.</a></h4>

<h3>KANT'S DOCTRINE OF CONSCIENCE.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>The alleged Practical Reason with its Categorical Imperative, is
manifestly very closely connected with Conscience, although essentially
different from it in two respects. In the first place, the Categorical
Imperative, as commanding, necessarily speaks <b>before</b> the
act, whereas Conscience does not till afterwards. <b>Before</b>
the act Conscience can at best only speak <b>indirectly</b>, that
is, by means of reflection, which holds up to it the recollection
of previous cases, in which similar acts after they were committed
received its disapproval. It is on this that the etymology of the word
<b>Gewissen</b> (Conscience) appears to me to rest, because <b>only
what has already taken place is gewiss</b><a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (certain). Undoubtedly,
through external inducement and kindled emotion, or by reason of the
internal discord of bad humour, impure, base thoughts, and evil desires
rise up in all people, even in the best. But for these a man is not
morally responsible, and need not load his conscience with them;
since they only show what the genus <i>homo,</i> not what the individual,
who thinks them, would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> capable of doing. Other motives, if not
simultaneously, yet almost immediately, come into his consciousness,
and confronting the unworthy inclinations prevent them from ever being
crystallised into deeds; thus causing them to resemble the out-voted
minority of an acting committee. By deeds alone each person gains an
empirical knowledge no less of himself than of others, just as it is
deeds alone that burden the conscience. For, unlike thoughts, these are
not problematic; on the contrary, they are certain (<i>gewiss</i>), they are
unchangeable, and are not only thought, but <b>known</b> (<i>gewusst</i>).
The Latin <i>conscientia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_53" id="FNanchor_2_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_53" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the Greek <i>συνείδησις</i><a name="FNanchor_3_54" id="FNanchor_3_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_54" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> have the same
sense. Conscience is thus the <b>knowledge</b> that a man has about
what he has done.</p>

<p>The second point of difference between the alleged Categorical
Imperative and Conscience is, that the latter always draws its
material from experience; which the former cannot do, since it is
purely <i>a priori</i>. Nevertheless, we may reasonably suppose that Kant's
Doctrine of Conscience will throw some light on this new conception
of an <b>absolute Ought</b> which he introduced. His theory is
most completely set forth in the <i>Metaphysische Anfangsgründe zur
Tugendlehre</i>, § 13, and in the following criticism I shall assume that
the few pages which contain it are lying before the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>The Kantian interpretation of Conscience makes an exceedingly imposing
effect, before which one used to stand with reverential awe, and
all the less confidence was felt in demurring to it, because there
lay heavy on the mind the ever-present fear of having theoretical
objections construed as practical, and, if the correctness of Kant's
view were denied, of being regarded as devoid of conscience. I,
however, cannot be led astray in this manner, since the question
here is of theory, not of practice; and I am not concerned with the
preaching of Morals, but with the exact investigation of the ultimate
ethical basis.</p>

<p>We notice at once that Kant employs exclusively Latin legal
terminology, which, however, would seem little adapted to reflect the
most secret stirrings of the human heart. Yet this language, this
judicial way of treating the subject, he retains from first to last,
as though it were essential and proper to the matter. And so we find
brought upon the stage of our inner self a complete Court of justice,
with indictment, judge, plaintiff, defendant, and sentence;&mdash;nothing is
wanting. Now if this tribunal, as portrayed by Kant, really existed in
our breasts, it would be astonishing if a single person could be found
to be, I do not say, <b>so bad</b>, but <b>so stupid</b>, as to act
against his conscience. For such a supernatural assize, of an entirely
special kind, set up in our consciousness, such a secret court&mdash;like
another Fehmgericht<a name="FNanchor_4_55" id="FNanchor_4_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_55" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;held in the dark recesses of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> inmost being,
would inspire everybody with a terror and fear of the gods strong
enough to really keep him from grasping at short transient advantages,
in face of the dreadful threats of superhuman powers, speaking in tones
so near and so clear. In real life, on the contrary, we find, that
the efficiency of conscience is generally considered such a vanishing
quantity that all peoples have bethought themselves of helping it out
by means of positive religion, or even of entirely replacing it by the
latter. Moreover, if Conscience were indeed of this peculiar nature,
the Royal Society could never have thought of the question put for the
present Prize Essay.</p>

<p>But if we look more closely at Kant's exposition, we shall find
that its imposing effect is mainly produced by the fact that he
attributes to the moral verdict passed on ourselves, as its peculiar
and essential characteristic, a form which in fact is not so at all.
This metaphorical bar of judgment is no more applicable to moral
self-examination than it is to every other reflection as regards
what we have done, and might have done otherwise, where no ethical
question is involved. For it is not only true that the same procedure
of indictment, defence, and sentence is occasionally assumed by that
obviously spurious and artificial conscience which is based on mere
superstition; as, for instance, when a Hindu reproaches himself with
having been the murderer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> a cow, or when a Jew remembers that he has
smoked his pipe at home on the Sabbath; but even the self-questioning
which springs from no ethical source, being indeed rather unmoral than
moral, often appears in a shape of this sort, as the following case
may exemplify. Suppose I, good-naturedly, but thoughtlessly, have made
myself surety for a friend, and suppose there comes with evening the
clear perception of the heavy responsibility I have taken on myself&mdash;a
responsibility that may easily involve me in serious trouble, as the
wise old saying, <i>ἐγγύα παρά δ' ἃτα</i>!<a name="FNanchor_5_56" id="FNanchor_5_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_56" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> predicts; then at once there
rise up within me the Accuser and the Counsel for the defence, ready
to confront each other. The latter endeavours to palliate my rashness
in giving bail so hastily, by pointing out the stress of circumstance
or of obligation, or, it may be, the simple straightforwardness of
the transaction; perhaps he even seeks excuse by commending my kind
heart. Last of all comes the Judge who inexorably passes the sentence:
"A fool's piece of work!" and I am overwhelmed with confusion So much
for this judicial form of which Kant is so fond; his other modes of
expression are, for the most part, open to the same criticism. For
instance, that which he attributes to conscience, at the beginning of
the paragraph, as its peculiar property, applies equally to all other
scruples of an entirely different sort. He says: "It (conscience)
follows him like his shadow, try though he may to escape. By pleasures
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> distractions he may be stupefied and billed to sleep, but he
cannot avoid occasionally waking up and coming to himself; and then he
is immediately aware of the terrible voice," etc. Obviously, this may
be just as well understood, word for word, of the secret consciousness
of some person of private means, who feels that his expenses far exceed
his income, and that thus his capital is being affected, and will
gradually melt away.</p>

<p>We have seen that Kant represents the use of legal terms as essential
to the subject, and that he keeps to them from beginning to end; let
it now be noted how he employs the same style for the following finely
devised sophism. He says: "That a person accused by his conscience
should be identified with the judge is an absurd way of portraying a
court of justice; for in that case the accuser would invariably lose."
And he adds, by way of elucidating this statement, a very ambiguous
and obscure note. His conclusion is that, if we would avoid falling
into a contradiction, we must think of the judge (in the judicial
conscience-drama that is enacted in our breasts) as different from us,
in fact, as another person; nay more, as one that is an omniscient
knower of hearts, whose hests are obligatory on all, and who is
almighty for every purpose of executive authority.<a name="FNanchor_6_57" id="FNanchor_6_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_57" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He thus passes by
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> perfectly smooth path from conscience to superstition, making the
latter a necessary consequence of the former; while he is secretly sure
that he will be all the more willingly followed because the reader's
earliest training will have certainly rendered him familiar with such
ideas, if not have made them his second nature. Here, then, Kant finds
an easy task,&mdash;a thing he ought rather to have despised; for he
should have concerned himself not only with preaching, but also with
practising truthfulness. I entirely reject the above quoted sentence,
and all the conclusions consequent thereon, and I declare it to be
nothing but a shuffling trick. It is <b>not true</b> that the accuser
must always lose, when the accused is the same person as the judge;
at least not in the court of judgment in our hearts. In the instance
I gave of one man going surety for another, did the accuser lose? Or
must we in this case also, if we wish to avoid a contradiction, really
assume a personification after Kant's fashion, and be driven to view
objectively as <b>another person</b> that voice whose deliverance would
have been those terrible words: "A fool's piece of work!"? A sort of
Mercury, forsooth, in living flesh? Or perhaps a prosopopoeia of the
<i>Μῆτις</i> (cunning) recommended by Homer (<i>Il.</i> xxiii. 313 sqq.)?<a name="FNanchor_7_58" id="FNanchor_7_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_58" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But thus we should only be landed, as before, on the broad path of
superstition, aye, and pagan superstition too.</p>

<p>It is in this passage that Kant indicates his Moral Theology, briefly
indeed, yet not without all its vital points. The fact that he takes
care, not to attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> to it any objective validity, but rather to
present it merely as a form subjectively unavoidable, does not free him
from the arbitrariness with which he constructs it, even though he only
claims its necessity for human consciousness. His fabric rests, as we
have seen, on a tissue of baseless assumptions.</p>

<p>So much, then, is certain. The entire imagery&mdash;that of a judicial
drama&mdash;whereby Kant depicts conscience is wholly unessential and in
no way peculiar to it; although he keeps this figure, as if it were
proper to the subject, right through to the end, in order finally
to deduce certain conclusions from it. As a matter of fact it is a
sufficiently common form, which our thoughts easily take when we
consider any circumstance of real life. It is due for the most part to
the conflict of opposing motives which usually spring up, and which
are successively weighed and tested by our reflecting reason. And no
difference is made whether these motives are moral or egoistic in their
nature, nor whether our deliberations are concerned with some action in
the past, or in the future. Now if we strip from Kant's exposition its
dress of legal metaphor, which is only an optional dramatic appendage,
the surrounding nimbus with all its imposing effect immediately
disappears as well, and there remains nothing but the fact that
sometimes, when we think over our actions, we are seized with a certain
self-dissatisfaction, which is marked by a special characteristic.
It is with our conduct <i>per se</i> that we are discontented, not with
its result, and this feeling does not, as in every other case in
which we regret the stupidity of our behaviour, rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> on egoistic
grounds. For on these occasions the cause of our dissatisfaction is
precisely because we have been too egoistic, because we have taken
too much thought for ourselves, and not enough for our neighbour; or
perhaps even because, without any resulting advantage, we have made
the misery of others an object in itself. That we may be dissatisfied
with ourselves, and saddened by reason of sufferings which we have
inflicted, not undergone, is a plain fact and impossible to be denied.
The connection of this with the only ethical basis that can stand an
adequate test we shall examine further on. But Kant, like a clever
special pleader, tried by magnifying and embellishing the original
<i>datum</i> to make all that he possibly could of it, in order to prepare a
very broad foundation for his Ethics and Moral Theology.</p>

<h3>KANT'S DOCTRINE OF THE INTELLIGIBLE<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor" style="font-size: 0.7em; font-weight: normal;">[1]</a> AND EMPIRICAL CHARACTER. THEORY
OF FREEDOM.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>The attack I have made, in the cause of truth, on Kant's system of
Morals, does not, like those of my predecessors, touch the surface
only, but penetrates to its deepest roots. It seems, therefore,
only just that, before I leave this part of my subject, I should
bring to remembrance the brilliant and conspicuous service which he
nevertheless rendered to ethical science. I allude to his doctrine of
the co-existence of Freedom and Necessity. We find it first in the
<i>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</i> (pp. 533-554 of the first, and pp. 561-582
of the fifth, edition); but it is still more clearly expounded in the
<i>Kritik der Praktischen Vernunft</i> (fourth edition, pp. 169-179; R., pp.
224-231).</p>

<p>The strict and absolute necessity of the acts of Will, determined by
motives as they arise, was first shown by Hobbes, then by Spinoza,
and Hume, and also by Dietrich von Holbach in his <i>Système de la
Nature</i>; and lastly by Priestley it was most completely and precisely
demonstrated. This point, indeed, has been so clearly proved, and
placed beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> all doubt, that it must be reckoned among the number of
perfectly established truths, and only crass ignorance could continue
to speak of a freedom, of a <i>liberum arbitrium indifferentiae</i> (a
free and indifferent choice) in the individual acts of men. Nor did
Kant, owing to the irrefutable reasoning of his predecessors, hesitate
to consider the Will as fast bound in the chains of Necessity, the
matter admitting, as he thought, of no further dispute or doubt. This
is proved by all the passages in which he speaks of freedom only from
the <b>theoretical</b> standpoint. Nevertheless, it is true that our
actions are attended with a consciousness of independence and original
initiative, which makes us recognise them as our own work, and every
one with ineradicable certainty feels that he is the real author
of his conduct, and morally <b>responsible</b> for it. But since
responsibility implies the possibility of having acted otherwise,
which possibility means freedom in some sort or manner; therefore
in the consciousness of responsibility is indirectly involved also
the consciousness of freedom. The key to resolve the contradiction,
that thus arises out of the nature of the case, was at last found by
Kant through the distinction he drew with profound acumen, between
phaenomena and the Thing in itself (<i>das Ding an sich</i>). This
distinction is the very core of his whole philosophy, and its greatest
merit.</p>

<p>The individual, with his immutable, innate character strictly
determined in all his modes of expression by the law of Causality,
which, as acting through the medium of the intellect, is here called
by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> name of Motivation,&mdash;the individual so constituted is only the
<b>phaenomenon</b> (<i>Erscheinung</i>). The <b>Thing</b> in itself which
underlies this phaenomenon is outside of Time and Space, consequently
free from all succession and plurality, one, and changeless. Its
constitution in itself is the <b>intelligible character</b>, which
is equally present in all the acts of the individual, and stamped on
every one of them, like the impress of a signet on a thousand seals.
The empirical character of the phaenomenon&mdash;the character which
manifests itself in time, and in succession of acts&mdash;is thus determined
by the intelligible character; and consequently, the individual, as
phaenomenon, in all his modes of expression, which are called forth
by motives, must show the invariableness of a natural law. Whence it
results that all his actions are governed by strict necessity. Now
it used to be commonly maintained that the character of a man may
be transformed by moral admonitions and remonstrances appealing to
reason; but when the distinction between the intelligible and empirical
character had once been drawn, it followed that the unchangeableness,
the inflexible rigidity of the empirical character, which thinking
people had always observed, was explained and traced to a rational
basis, and consequently accepted as an established fact by Philosophy.
Thus the latter was so far harmonised with experience, and ceased to
stand abashed, before popular wisdom, which long before had spoken the
words of truth in the Spanish proverb: <i>Lo que entra con el capillo,
sale con la mortaja</i> (that which comes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> with the child's cap, goes
out with the winding-sheet); or: <i>Lo que en la leche se mama, en la
mortaja se derrama</i> (what is imbibed with the milk, is poured out again
in the winding-sheet).</p>

<p>This doctrine of the co-existence of Freedom and Necessity I regard
as the greatest of all the achievements of human sagacity. With the
Transcendental Aesthetics it forms the two great diamonds in the crown
of Kant's fame, which will never pass away. In his Treatise on Freedom,
Schelling obviously served up the Kantian teaching in a paraphrase,
which by reason of its lively colouring and graphic delineation, is for
many people more comprehensible. The work would deserve praise if its
author had had the honesty to say that he is drawing on Kant's wisdom,
not on his own. As it is, a certain part of the philosophic public
still credits him with the entire performance.</p>

<p>The theory itself, and the whole question regarding the nature of
Freedom, can be better understood if we view them in connection with
a general truth, which I think, is most concisely expressed by a
formula frequently occurring in the scholastic writings: <i>Operari
sequitur esse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_60" id="FNanchor_2_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_60" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In other words, everything in the world operates in
accordance with what it is, in accordance with its inherent nature, in
which, consequently, all its modes of expression are already contained
potentially, while actually they are manifested when elicited by
external causes; so that external causes are the means whereby the
essential constitution of the thing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> revealed. And the modes of
expression so resulting form the <b>empirical</b> character; whereas
its hidden, ultimate basis, which is inaccessible to experience, is
the <b>intelligible</b> character, that is, the real nature <i>per se</i>
of the particular thing in question. Man forms no exception to the
rest of nature; he too has a changeless character, which, however,
is strictly individual and different in each case. This character is
of course <b>empirical</b> as far as we can grasp it, and therefore
only <b>phaenomenal</b>; while the <b>intelligible</b> character is
whatever may be the real nature in itself of the person. His actions
one and all, being, as regards their external constitution, determined
by motives, can never be shaped otherwise than in accordance with the
unchangeable individual character. As a man is, so he his bound to act.
Hence for a given person in every single case, there is absolutely only
one way of acting possible: <i>Operari sequitur esse</i><a name="FNanchor_3_61" id="FNanchor_3_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_61" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Freedom belongs
only to the intelligible character, not to the empirical. The <i>operari</i>
(conduct) of a given individual is necessarily determined externally
by motives, internally by his character; therefore everything that he
does necessarily takes place. But in his <i>esse</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, in what he
is), <b>there</b>, we find Freedom. He <b>might have been</b> something
different; and guilt or merit attaches to that which he is. All that
he does follows from what he is, as a mere corollary. Through Kant's
doctrine we are freed from the primary error of connecting Necessity
with <i>esse</i> (what one is), and Freedom with <i>operari</i> (what one does);
we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> become aware that this is a misplacement of terms, and that exactly
the inverse arrangement is the true one. Hence it is clear that the
moral responsibility of a man, while it, first of all, and obviously,
of course, touches what he does, yet at bottom touches what he is;
because, what he is being the original <b>datum</b>, his conduct, as
motives arise, could never take any other course than that which it
actually does take. But, however strict be the necessity, whereby,
in the individual, acts are elicited by motives, it yet never occurs
to anybody&mdash;not even to him who is convinced of this necessity&mdash;to
exonerate himself on that account, and cast the blame on the motives;
for he knows well enough that, objectively considered, any given
circumstance, and its causes, perfectly admitted quite a different,
indeed, a directly opposite course of action; nay, that such a course
would actually have taken place, <b>if only he had been a different
person</b>. That he is precisely such a one as his conduct proclaims
him to be, and no other&mdash;this it is for which he feels himself
responsible; in his <i>esse</i> (what he is) lies the vulnerable place,
where the sting of conscience penetrates. For Conscience is nothing
but acquaintance with one's own self&mdash;an acquaintance that arises out
of one's actual mode of conduct, and which becomes ever more intimate.
So that it is the <i>esse</i> (what one is) which in reality is accused
by conscience, while the <i>operari</i> (what one does) supplies the
incriminating evidence. Since we are only conscious of <b>Freedom</b>
through the sense of <b>responsibility</b>; therefore where the latter
lies the former must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> also be; in the <i>esse</i> (in one's being). It is
the <i>operari</i> (what one does) that is subject to necessity. But we can
only get to know ourselves, as well as others <b>empirically</b>; we
have no <i>a priori</i> knowledge of our character. Certainly our natural
tendency is to cherish a very high opinion of it, because the maxim:
<i>Quisque praesumitur bonus, donec probetur contrarium</i> (every one is
presumed to be good, until the contrary is proved), is perhaps even
more true of the inner court of justice than of the world's tribunals.</p>



<h4><a id="NOTEc"></a>NOTE.</h4>


<p>He who is capable of recognising the essential part of a thought,
though clothed in a dress very different from what he is familiar with,
will see, as I do, that this Kantian doctrine of the intelligible and
empirical character is a piece of insight already possessed by Plato.
The difference is, that with Kant it is sublimated to an abstract
clearness; with Plato it is treated mythically, and connected with
metempsychosis, because, as he did not perceive the ideality of Time,
he could only represent it under a temporal form. The identity of the
one doctrine with the other becomes exceedingly plain, if we read the
explanation and illustration of the Platonic myth, which Porphyrius has
given with such clear exactitude, that its agreement with the abstract
language of Kant comes out unmistakably. In the second book of his
Eclogues, chap. 8, §§ 37-40,<a name="FNanchor_4_62" id="FNanchor_4_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_62" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Stobaeus has preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> for us <i>in
extenso</i> that part of one of Porphyrius' lost writings which specially
comments on the myth in question, as Plato gives it in the second half
of the tenth book of the Republic.<a name="FNanchor_5_63" id="FNanchor_5_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_63" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The whole section is eminently
worth reading. As a specimen I shall quote the short § 39, in the hope
of inducing any one who cares for these things to study Stobaeus for
himself. It will then immediately become apparent that this Platonic
myth is nothing less than an allegory of the profound truth which Kant
stated in its abstract purity, as the doctrine of the intelligible and
empirical character, and consequently that the latter had been reached,
in its essentials, by Plato thousands of years ago. Indeed, this view
seems to go back much further still, for Porphyrins is of opinion that
Plato took it from the Egyptians. Certainly we already find the same
theory in the Brahmanical doctrine of metempsychosis, and it is from
this Indian source that the Egyptian priests, in all probability,
derived their wisdom. § 39 is as follows:&mdash;</p>

said) have free power, before passing into bodies and different modes
of being, to choose this or that form of life, which they will pass
through in a certain kind of existence, and in a body adapted thereto.
(For a soul may choose a lion's, equally with a man's, mode of being.)
But this free power of choice is removed simultaneously with entrance
into one or other of such forms of life. For when once they have
descended into bodies, and instead of unfettered souls have become the
souls of living things, then they take that measure of free power which
belongs in each case to the organism of the living thing. In some forms
this power is very intelligent and full of movement, as in man; in
some it has but little energy, and is of a simple nature, as in almost
all other creatures. Moreover, this free power depends on the organism
in such a way that while its capability of action is caused by itself
alone, its impulses are determined by the desires which have their
origin in the organism.&mdash;(<i>Translator.</i>)</p></div>

<h3>FICHTE'S ETHICS AS A MAGNIFYING GLASS FOR THE ERRORS OF THE KANTIAN.</h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>Just as in Anatomy and Zoology, many things are not so obvious to the
pupil in preparations and natural products as in engravings where there
is some exaggeration; so if there is any one who, after the above
criticism, is still not entirely satisfied as to the worthlessness
of the Kantian foundation of Ethics, I would recommend him Fichte's
<i>System der Sittenlehre</i>, as a sure means of freeing him from all doubt.</p>

<p>In the old German Marionnettes a fool always accompanied the emperor,
or hero, so that he might afterwards give in his own way a highly
coloured version of what had been said or done In like manner behind
the great Kant there stands the author of the <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id="FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_65" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
a true <i>Wissenschaftsleere<a name="FNanchor_2_66" id="FNanchor_2_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_66" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</i> In order to secure his own, and his
family's welfare, Fichte formed the idea of creating a sensation by
means of subtle mystification. It was a very suitable and reasonable
plan, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> the nature of the German philosophic public, and he
executed it admirably by outdoing Kant in every particular. He appeared
as the latter's living superlative, and produced a perfect caricature
of his philosophy by magnifying all its salient points. Nor did the
Ethics escape similar treatment? In his <i>System der Sittenlehre</i>, we
find the Categorical Imperative grown into a Despotic Imperative; while
the absolute "Ought," the law-giving Reason, and the Hest of Duty
have developed into a <b>moral Fate</b>, an unfathomable Necessity,
requiring mankind to act strictly in accordance with certain maxims.
To judge (pp. 308, 309) from the pompous show made, a great deal must
depend on these formulae, although one never quite discovers what.
So much only seems clear. As in bees there is implanted an instinct
to build cells and a hive for life in common, so men (it is alleged)
are endowed with an impulse leading them to play in common a great,
strictly moral, world-embracing Comedy, their part being merely to
figure as puppets&mdash;nothing else. But there is this important difference
between the bees and men. The hive is really brought to completion;
while instead of a moral World-Comedy, as a matter of fact, an
exceedingly immoral one is enacted. Here, then, we see the imperative
form of the Kantian Ethics, the moral Law, and the absolute "Ought"
pushed further and further till a system of ethical <b>Fatalism</b> is
evolved, which, as it is worked out, lapses at times into the comic.<a name="FNanchor_3_67" id="FNanchor_3_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_67" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>If in Kant's doctrine we trace a certain moral pedantry; with Fichte
this pedantry reaches the absurd, and furnishes abundant material
for satire. Let the reader notice, for example (pp. 407-409), how he
decides the well-known instance of casuistry, where of two human lives
one must be lost. We find indeed all the errors of Kant raised to the
superlative. Thus, on p. 199, we read: "To act in accordance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the dictates of sympathy, of compassion, and of loving-kindness is
distinctly unmoral; indeed this line of conduct, as such, is contrary
to morality." Again, on p. 402: "The impulse that makes us ready to
serve others must never be an inconsiderate good-nature, but a clearly
thought-out purpose; that, namely, of furthering as much as possible
the causality of Reason." However, between these sallies of ridiculous
pedantry, Fichte's real philosophic crudeness peeps out clearly
enough, as we might only expect in the case of a man whose teaching
left no time for learning. He seriously puts forward the <i>liberum
arbitrium indifferentiae</i> (a free and indifferent choice), giving as
its foundation the most trivial and frivolous reasons. (Pp. 160, 173,
205, 208, 237, 259, 261.) There can be no doubt that a motive, although
working through the medium of the intelligence, is, nevertheless, a
cause, and consequently involves the same necessity of effect as all
other causes; the corollary being that all human action is a strictly
necessary result. Whoever remains unconvinced of this, is still,
philosophically speaking, barbarous, and ignorant of the rudiments
of exact knowledge. The perception of the strict necessity governing
man's conduct forms the line of demarcation which separates philosophic
heads from all others; arrived at this limit Fichte clearly showed that
he belonged to the others. Moreover, following the footsteps of Kant
(p. 303), he proceeds to make various statements which are in direct
contradiction to the above mentioned passages; but this inconsistency,
like many more in his writings, only proves that he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> being one
who was never serious in the search for truth, possessed no strong
convictions to build on; as indeed for his purpose they were not in
the least necessary. Nothing is more laughable than the fact that this
man has received so much posthumous praise for strictly consequential
reasoning; his pedantic style full of loud declamation about trifling
matters being actually mistaken for such.</p>

<p>The most complete development of Fichte's system of <b>moral
Fatalism</b> is found in his last work: <i>Die Wissenschaftslehre in
ihrem Allgemeinen Umrisse Dargestellt</i>, Berlin, 1810. It has the
advantage of being only forty-six pages (duodecimo) long, while it
contains his whole philosophy in a nutshell. It is therefore to be
recommended to all those who consider their time too precious to be
wasted on his larger productions, which are framed with a length and
tediousness worthy of Christian Wolff, and with the intention, in
reality, of deluding, not of instructing the reader. In this little
treatise we read on p. 32: "The intuitive perception of a phaenomenal
world only came about, to the end that in such a world the Ego as the
<b>absolute Ought</b> might be visible to itself." On p. 33 we actually
find: "The <b>ought</b>," (<i>i.e.</i>, the moral necessity,) "of the
<b>Ought's</b> visibility;" and on p. 36: "An <b>ought</b>," (<i>i.e.</i>, a
moral necessity,) "of the perception that I <b>ought</b>." This, then,
is what we have come to so soon after Kant! <b>His imperative Form</b>,
with its unproved <b>Ought</b>, which it secured as a most convenient
<i>ποῡ στῶ</i> (standpoint), is indeed an <i>exemplar vitiis imitabile</i>!</p>

<p>For the rest, all that I have said does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> overthrow the service
Fichte rendered. Kant's philosophy, this late masterpiece of human
sagacity, in the very land where it arose, he obscured, nay, supplanted
by empty, bombastic superlatives, by extravagances, and by the nonsense
which is found, in his <i>Grundlage der gesammten Wissenschaftslehre,</i>
appearing under the disguise of profound penetration. His merit was
thus to show the world unmistakably what the capacity of the German
philosophical public is; for he made it play the part of a child who
is coaxed into giving up a precious gem in exchange for a Nürnberg
toy. The fame he obtained in this fashion still lives on credit; and
still Fichte is always mentioned in the same breath with Kant as being
another such <i>Ἡραkλῆς καὶ πίθηêκος!</i><a name="FNanchor_4_68" id="FNanchor_4_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_68" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Indeed his name is often
placed above the latter's.<a name="FNanchor_5_69" id="FNanchor_5_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_69" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It was, of course, Fichte's example that
encouraged his successors in the art of enveloping the German people,
in philosophic fog. These were animated by the same spirit, and crowned
with the same prosperity. Every one knows their names; nor is this the
place to consider them at length. Needless to say, their different
opinions, down to the minutest details, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> still set forth, and
seriously discussed, by the Professors of Philosophy; as if one had
really to do with philosophers! We must, then, thank Fichte for lucid
documents now existing, which will have to be revised one day before
the Tribunal of posterity, that Court of Appeal from the verdicts of
the present, which&mdash;like the Last Judgment looked forward to by the
Saints&mdash;at almost all periods, has been left to give to true merit its
just award.</p>

he has his being, and if this end should not be attained, there is not
the least occasion for him to live." P. 347: "I am an instrument of the

Moral Law to nourish one's body, and study one's health; this of course
should be done in no way, and for no other purpose, except to provide
an <i>efficient instrument</i> for furthering the end decreed by Reason,
<i>i.e.</i>, its realisation,"&mdash;(cf. p. 371.) P. 376: "Every human body is
an instrument for furthering the end decreed by Reason, <i>i.e.</i>, its
realisation; therefore the greatest possible fitness of each instrument
must constitute for me an end: consequently I must take thought for
every one."&mdash;This is Fichte's derivation of loving-kindness! P. 377: "I
can and dare take thought for myself, solely because, and is so far as
I am, <i>an instrument of the Moral Law</i>." P. 388: "To defend a hunted
man at the risk of one's own life, is an absolute duty; whenever the
life of another human being is in danger, you have no right to think
of the safety of your own." P. 420: "In the province of the Moral

<h3>CONDITIONS OF THE PROBLEM.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Thus the foundation which Kant gave to Ethics, which for the last sixty
years has been regarded as a sure basis, proves to be an inadmissible
assumption, and merely theological Morals in disguise; it sinks
therefore before our eyes into the deep gulf of philosophic error,
which perhaps will never be filled up. That the previous attempts to
lay a foundation are still less satisfactory, I take for granted, as
I have already said. They consist, for the most part, of unproved
assertions, drawn from the impalpable world of dreams, and at the
same time&mdash;like Kant's system itself&mdash;full of an artificial subtlety
dealing with the finest distinctions, and resting on the most abstract
conceptions. We find difficult combinations; rules invented for the
purpose; formulae balanced on a needle's point; and stilted maxims,
from which it is no longer possible to look down and see life as it
really is with all its turmoil. Such niceties are doubtless admirably
adapted for the lecture-room, if only with a view to sharpening
the wits; but they can never be the cause of the impulse to act
justly and to do good, which is found in every man; as also they are
powerless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> to counterbalance the deep-seated tendency to injustice and
hardness of heart. Neither is it possible to fasten the reproaches of
conscience upon them; to attribute the former to the breaking of such
hair-splitting precepts only serves to make the same ridiculous. In a
word, artificial associations of ideas like these cannot possibly&mdash;if
we take the matter seriously&mdash;contain the true incentive to justice and
loving-kindness. Rather must this be something that requires but little
reflection, and still less abstraction and complicated synthesis;
something that, independent of the training of the understanding,.
speaks to every one, even to the rudest,&mdash;a something resting simply on
intuitive perception, and forcing its way home as a direct emanation
from the reality of things. So long as Ethics cannot point to a
foundation of this sort, she may go on with her discussions, and make
a great display in the lecture-rooms; but real life will only pour
contempt upon her. I must therefore give our moralists the paradoxical
advice, first to look about them a little among their fellow-men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>




<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IIc" id="CHAPTER_IIc">CHAPTER II</a></h4>

<h3>SCEPTICAL VIEW.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>But when we cast a retrospect over the attempts made, and made in vain,
for more than two thousand years, to find a sure basis for Ethics,
ought we not perhaps to think that after all there is no natural
morality, independent of human institution? Shall we not conclude that
all moral systems are nothing but artificial products, means invented
for the better restraint of the selfish and wicked race of men; and
further, that, as they have no internal credentials and no natural
basis, they would fail in their purpose, if without the support of
positive religion? The legal code and the police are not sufficient in
all cases; there are offences, the discovery of which is too difficult;
some, indeed, where punishment is a precarious matter; where, in short,
we are left without public protection. Moreover, the civil law can at
most enforce justice, not loving-kindness and beneficence; because,
of course, these are qualities as regards which every one would like
to play the passive, and no one the active, part. All this has given
rise to the hypothesis that morality rests solely on religion, and that
both have the same aim&mdash;that of being complementary to the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
inadequacy of state machinery and legislation. Consequently, there
cannot be (it is said) a natural morality, <i>i.e.</i>, one based simply
on the nature of things, or of man, and the fruitless search of
philosophers for its foundation is explained. This view is not without
plausibility; and we find it as far back as the Pyrrhonians:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<i>οὔτε ἀγάθον ἐστί ϕύσει, oὔτε κακόν</i>,<br />

</p>

<p>Also in modern times distinguished thinkers have given their adherence
to it. A careful examination therefore it deserves; although the easier
course would be to shelve it by giving an inquisitorial glance at the
consciences of those in whom such a theory could arise.</p>

<p>We should fall into a great, a very childish blunder, if we believed
all the just and legal actions of mankind to have a moral origin. This
is far from being the case. As a rule, between the justice, which men
practise, and genuine singleness of heart, there exists a relation
analogous to that between polite expressions, and the true love of
one's neighbour, which, unlike the former, does not ostensibly overcome
Egoism, but really does so. That honesty of sentiment, everywhere
so carefully exhibited, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> requires to be regarded as above all
suspicion; that deep indignation, which is stirred by the smallest
sign of a doubt in this direction, and is ready to break out into
furions anger;&mdash;to what are we to attribute these symptoms? None but
the inexperienced and simple will take them for pure coin, for the
working of a fine moral feeling, or conscience. In point of fact, the
general correctness of conduct which is adopted in human intercourse,
and insisted on as a rule no less immovable than the hills, depends
principally on two external necessities; first, on legal ordinance,
by virtue of which the rights of every man are protected by public
authority; and secondly, on the recognised need of possessing civil
honour, in other words, a good name, in order to advance in the world.
This is why the steps taken by the individual are closely watched by
public opinion, which is so inexorably severe that it never forgives
even a single false move or slip, but remembers it against the guilty
person as an indelible blot, all his life long. As far as this goes,
public opinion is wise enough; for, starting from the fundamental
principle: <i>Operari sequitur esse</i> (what one does is determined by what
one is), it shows its conviction that the character is unchangeable,
and that therefore what a man has once done, he will assuredly do
again, if only the circumstances be precisely similar. Such are the two
custodians that keep guard on the correct conduct of people, without
which, to speak frankly, we should be in a sad case, especially with
reference to property, this central point in human life, around which
the chief part of its energy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> activity revolves. For the purely
ethical motives to integrity, assuming that they exist, cannot as a
rule be applied, except very indirectly, to the question of ownership
as guaranteed by the state. These motives, in fact, have a direct and
essential bearing only on <b>natural</b> right; with <b>positive</b>
right their connection is merely indirect, in so far as the latter
is based on the former. Natural right, however, attaches to no other
property than that which has been gained by one's own exertion;
because, when this is seized, the owner is at the same time robbed of
all the efforts he expended in acquiring it. The theory of preoccupancy
I reject absolutely, but cannot here set forth its refutation.<a name="FNanchor_2_71" id="FNanchor_2_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_71" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Now of course all estate based on positive right ought ultimately
and in the last instance (it matters not how many intermediate links
are involved) to rest on the natural right of possession. But what
a distance there is, in most cases, between the title-deeds, that
belong to our civil life, and this natural right&mdash;their original
source! Indeed their connection with the latter is generally either
very difficult, or else impossible, to prove. What we hold is ours by
inheritance, by marriage, by success in the lottery; or if in no way
of this kind, still it is not gained by our own work, with the sweat
of the brow, but rather by shrewdness and bright ideas (<i>e.g.</i>, in the
field of speculation), yes, and sometimes even by our very stupidity,
which, through a conjunction of circumstances, is crowned and glorified
by the <i>Deus eventus.</i> It is only in a very small minority of cases
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> property is the fruit of real labour and toil; and even then
the work is usually mental, like that of lawyers, doctors, civilians,
teachers, etc.; and this in the eyes of the rude appears to cost but
little effort.</p>

<p>Now, when wealth is acquired in any such fashion, there is need of
considerable education before the ethical right can be recognised and
respected out of a purely moral impulse. Hence it comes about that
not a few secretly regard the possessions of others as held merely by
virtue of positive right. So, if they find means to wrest from another
man his goods, by using, or perhaps by evading, the laws, they feel
no scruples; for in their opinion he would lose what he holds, in the
same way in which he had previously obtained it, and they consequently
regard their own claims as equal to his. From their point of view, the
right of the stronger in civil society is superseded by the right of
the cleverer.</p>

<p>Incidentally we may notice that the <b>rich</b> man often shows an
inflexible correctness of conduct. Why? Because with his whole heart
he is attached to, and rigidly maintains, a rule, on the observance of
which his entire wealth, and all its attendant advantages, depend. For
this reason his profession of the principle: <i>Suum cuique</i> (to each his
own), is thoroughly in earnest, and shows an unswerving consistency.
No doubt there is an <b>objective</b> loyalty to sincerity and good
faith, which avails to keep them sacred; but such loyalty is based
simply on the fact that sincerity and good faith are the foundation of
all free intercourse among men; of good order; and of secure ownership.
Consequently they very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> often benefit <b>ourselves</b>, and with this
end in view they must be preserved even at some cost: just as a good
piece of land is worth a certain outlay. But integrity thus derived
is, as a rule, only to be met with among wealthy people, or at least
those who are engaged in a lucrative business. It is an especial
characteristic of tradesmen; because they have the strongest conviction
that for all the operations of commerce the one thing indispensable
is mutual trust and credit; and this is why mercantile honour stands
quite by itself. On the other hand, the <i>poor</i> man, who cannot make
both ends meet, and who, by reason of the unequal division of property,
sees himself condemned to want and hard work, while others before his
eyes are lapped in luxury and idleness, will not easily perceive that
the <i>raison d'être</i> of this inequality is a corresponding inequality of
service and honest industry. And if he does <b>not</b> recognise this,
how is he to be governed by the purely ethical motive to uprightness,
which should keep him from stretching out his hand to grasp the
superfluity of another? Generally, it is the order of government
as established by law that restrains him. But should ever the rare
occasion present itself when he discovers that he is beyond the reach
of the police, and that he could by a single act throw off the galling
burden of penury, which is aggravated by the sight of others' opulence;
if he feels this, and realises that he could thus enter into the
possession and enjoyment of all that he has so often coveted: what is
there then to stay his hand? Religions dogmas? It is seldom that faith
is so firm. A purely moral incentive to be just and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> upright? Perhaps
in a few isolated cases. But in by far the greater number there is in
reality nothing but the anxiety a man feels to keep his good name,
his civil honour&mdash;a thing that touches closely even those in humble
circumstances. He knows the imminent danger incurred of having to pay
for dishonest conduct by being expelled from the great Masonic Lodge
of honourable people who live correct lives. He knows that property
all over the world is in their hands, and duly apportioned among
themselves, and that they wield the power of making him an outcast for
life from good society, in case he commit a single disgraceful action.
He knows that whoever takes one false step in this direction is marked
as a person that no one trusts, whose company every one shuns, and from
whom all advancement is cut off; to whom, as being "a fellow that has
stolen," the proverb is applied: "He who steals once is a thief all his
life."</p>

<p>These, then, are the guards that watch over correct behaviour between
man and man, and he who has lived, and kept his eyes open, will admit
that the vast majority of honourable actions in human intercourse must
be attributed to them; nay, he will go further, and say that there are
not wanting people who hope to elude even their vigilance, and who
regard justice and honesty merely as an external badge, as a flag,
under the protection of which they can carry out their own freebooting
propensities with better success. We need not therefore break out into
holy wrath, and buckle on our armour, if a moralist is found to suggest
that perhaps all integrity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> uprightness may be at bottom only
conventional. This is what Holbach, Helvetius, d'Alembert, and others
of their time did; and, following out the theory, they endeavoured
with great acumen to trace back all moral conduct to egoistic motives,
however remote and indirect. That their position is literally true of
most just actions, as having an ultimate foundation centred in the
Self, I have shown above. That it is also true to a large extent of
what is done in kindness and humanity, there can be no doubt; acts of
this sort often arise from love of ostentation, still oftener from
belief in a retribution to come, which may be dealt out in the second
or even the third power;<a name="FNanchor_3_72" id="FNanchor_3_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_72" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or they can be explained by other egoistic
motives. Nevertheless, it is equally certain that there occur actions
of disinterested good-will and entirely voluntary justice. To prove
the latter statement, I appeal only to the facts of experience, not
to those of consciousness. There are isolated, yet indisputable cases
on record, where not only the danger of legal prosecution, but also
all chance of discovery, and even of suspicion has been excluded, and
where, notwithstanding, the poor man has rendered to the rich his own.
For example, things lost, and found, have been given back without any
thought or hope of reward; a deposit made by a third person has been
restored after his death to the rightful owner; a poor man, secretly
intrusted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> a treasure by a fugitive, has faithfully kept, and
then returned, it. Instances of this sort can be found, beyond all
doubt; only the surprise, the emotion, and the high respect awakened,
when we hear of them, testify to the fact that they are unexpected
and very exceptional. There are in truth really honest people: like
four-leaved clover, their existence is not a fiction. But Hamlet uses
no hyperbole when he says: "To be honest, as this world goes, is to be
one man pick'd out of ten thousand." If it be objected that, after all,
religious dogmas, involving rewards and penalties in another world,
are at the root of conduct as above described; cases could probably be
adduced where the actors possessed no religions faith whatever. And
this is a thing by no means so infrequent as is generally maintained.</p>

<p>Those who combat the <b>sceptical view</b> appeal specially to the
testimony of <b>conscience</b>. But conscience itself is impugned,
and doubts are raised about its natural origin. Now, as a matter of
fact, there is a <i>conscientia spuria</i> (false conscience), which is
often confounded with the true. The regret and anxiety which many a
man feels for what he has done is frequently, at bottom, nothing but
fear of the possible consequences. Not a few people, if they break
external, voluntary, and even absurd rules, suffer from painful
searchings of heart, exactly similar to those inflicted by the real
conscience. Thus, for instance, a bigoted Jew, if on Saturday he
should smoke a pipe at home, becomes really oppressed with the sense
of having disobeyed the command in Exodus xxxv. 3: "Ye shall kindle
no fire throughout your habitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> upon the Sabbath day." How often
it happens that a nobleman or officer is the victim of self-reproach,
because on some occasion or other he has not properly complied with
that fools' codex, which is called knightly honour! Nay more: there
are many of this class, who, if they see the impossibility of merely
doing enough in some quarrel to satisfy the above-named code&mdash;to say
nothing of keeping their pledged word of honour&mdash;are ready to shoot
themselves. (Instances of both have come under my knowledge.) And this,
while the self-same man would with an easy mind break his promise every
day, if only the shibboleth "Honour" be not involved. In short, every
inconsequent, and thoughtless action, all conduct contrary to our
prejudices, principles, or convictions, whatever these may be; indeed,
every indiscretion, every mistake, every piece of stupidity rankles
in us secretly, and leaves its sting behind. The average individual,
who thinks his conscience such an imposing structure, would be
surprised, could he see of what it actually consists: probably of about
one-fifth, fear of men; one-fifth, superstition; one-fifth, prejudice;
one-fifth, vanity; and one-fifth, habit. So that in reality he is no
better than the Englishman, who said quite frankly: "I cannot afford
to keep a conscience." Religious people of every creed, as a rule,
understand by conscience nothing else than the dogmas and injunctions
of their religion, and the self-examination based thereon; and it
is in this sense that the expressions <b>coercion of conscience</b>
and <b>liberty of conscience</b> are used. The same interpretation
was always given by the theologians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> schoolmen, and casuists of the
middle ages and of later times. Whatever a man knew of the formulae and
prescriptions of the Church, coupled with a resolution to believe and
obey it, constituted his conscience. Thus we find the terms "a doubting
conscience," "an opinionated conscience," "an erring conscience," and
the like; and councils were held, and confessors employed, for the
special purpose of setting such irregularities straight. How little the
conception of conscience, just as other conceptions, is determined by
its own object; how differently it is viewed by different people; how
wavering and uncertain it appears in books; all this is briefly but
clearly set forth in Stäudlin's <i>Geschichte der Lehre vom Gewissen</i>.
These facts taken in conjunction are not calculated to establish the
reality of the thing; they have rather given rise to the question
whether there is in truth a genuine, inborn conscience. I have already
had occasion in Part II., Chapter VIII., where the theory of Freedom is
discussed, to touch on my view of conscience, and I shall return to it
below.</p>

<p>All these sceptical objections added together do not in the least avail
to prove that no true morality exists, however much they may moderate
our expectations as to the moral tendency in man, and the natural basis
of Ethics. Undoubtedly a great deal that is ascribed to the ethical
sense can be proved to spring from other incentives; and when we
contemplate the moral depravity of the world, it is sufficiently clear
that the stimulus for good cannot be very powerful, especially as it
often does not work even in cases where the opposing motives are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> weak,
although then the individual difference of character makes itself fully
felt.</p>

<p>It should be observed that this moral depravity is all the more
difficult to discern, because its manifestations are checked and
cloaked by public order, as enforced by law; by the necessity of
having a good name; and even by ordinary polite manners. And this is
not all. People commonly suppose that in the education of the young
their moral interests are furthered by representing uprightness and
virtue as principles generally followed by the world. Later on, it is
often to their great harm that experience teaches them something else;
for the discovery, that the instructors of their early years were the
first to deceive them, is likely to have a more mischievous effect on
their morality than if these persons had given them the first example
of ingenuous truthfulness, by saying frankly: "The world is sunk in
evil, and men are not what they ought to be; but be not misled thereby,
and see that you do better." All this, as I have said, increases the
difficulty of recognising the real immorality of mankind. The state
&mdash;this masterpiece, which sums up the self-conscious, intelligent
egoism of all&mdash;consigns the rights of each person to a power, which,
being enormously superior to that of the individual, compels him to
respect the rights of all others. This is the leash that restrains
the limitless egoism of nearly every one, the malice of many, the
cruelty of not a few. The illusion thus arising is so great that,
when in special cases, where the executive power is ineffective, or
is eluded, the insatiable covetousness, the base greed, the deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
hypocrisy, or the spiteful tricks of men are apparent in all their
ugliness, we recoil with horror, supposing that we have stumbled on
some unheard-of monster: whereas, without the compulsion of law, and
the necessity of keeping an honourable name, these sights would be of
every day occurrence. In order to discover what, from a moral point
of view, human beings are made of, we must study anarchist records,
and the proceedings connected with criminals. The thousands that
throng before our eyes, in peaceful intercourse each with the other,
can only be regarded as so many tigers and wolves, whose teeth are
secured by a strong muzzle. Let us now suppose this muzzle cast off,
or, in other words, the power of the state abolished; the contemplation
of the spectacle then to be awaited would make all thinking people
shudder; and they would thus betray the small amount of trust they
really have in the efficiency either of religion, or of conscience, or
of the natural basis of Morals, whatever it be. But if these immoral,
antinomian forces should be unshackled and let loose, it is precisely
then that the true moral incentive, hidden before, would reveal its
activity, and consequently be most easily recognised. And nothing
would bring out so clearly as this the prodigious moral difference of
character between man and man; it would be found to be as great as the
intellectual, which is saying much.</p>

<p>The objection will perhaps be raised that Ethics is not concerned with
what men actually do, but that it is the science which treats of what
their conduct <b>ought</b> to be. Now this is exactly the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
which I deny. In the critical part of the present treatise I have
sufficiently demonstrated that the conception of <b>ought</b>, in
other words, the <b>imperative form</b> of Ethics, is valid only in
theological morals, outside of which it loses all sense and meaning.
The end which I place before Ethical Science is to point out all the
varied moral lines of human conduct; to explain them; and to trace
them to their ultimate source. Consequently there remains no way of
discovering the basis of Ethics except the empirical. We must search
and see whether we can find any actions to which we are obliged to
ascribe <b>genuine moral worth</b>: actions, that is, of voluntary
justice, of pure loving-kindness, and of true nobleness. Such conduct,
when found, is to be regarded as a given phaenomenon, which has to
be properly accounted for; in other words, its real origin must be
explored, and this will involve the investigation and explanation of
the peculiar motives which lead men to actions so radically distinct
from all others, that they form a class by themselves. These motives,
together with a responsive susceptibility for them, will constitute
the ultimate basis of morality, and the knowledge of them will be
the foundation of Ethics. This is the humble path to which I direct
the Science of Morals. It contains no construction <i>a priori</i>, no
absolute legislation for all rational beings <i>in abstracto</i>; it lacks
all official, academic sanction. Therefore, whoever thinks it not
sufficiently fashionable, may return to the Categorical Imperative;
to the Shibboleth of "Human Dignity"; to the empty phrases, the
cobwebs, and the soap-bubbles of the Schools; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> principles on which
experience pours contempt at every step, and of which no one, outside
the lecture-rooms knows anything, or has ever had the least notion. On
the other hand, the foundation which is reached by following my path
is upheld by experience; and it is experience which daily and hourly
delivers its silent testimony in favour of my theory.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IIIc" id="CHAPTER_IIIc">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<h3>ANTIMORAL<a name="FNanchor_1_73" id="FNanchor_1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_73" class="fnanchor" style="font-size: 0.7em; font-weight: normal;">[1]</a> INCENTIVES.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>The chief and fundamental incentive in man, as in animals, is
<b>Egoism</b>, that is, the urgent impulse to exist, and exist under
the best circumstances. The German word <i>Selbstsucht</i> (self-seeking)
involves a false secondary idea of disease (<i>Sucht</i>).<a name="FNanchor_2_74" id="FNanchor_2_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_74" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The term
<i>Eigennutz</i> (self-interest) denotes Egoism, so far as the latter
is guided by reason, which enables it, by means of reflection, to
prosecute its purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> systematically; so that animals may be called
egoistic, but not self-interested (<i>eigennutzig</i>). I shall therefore
retain the word <b>Egoism</b> for the general idea. Now this Egoism
is, both in animals and men, connected in the closest way with their
very essence and being; indeed, it is one and the same thing. For this
reason all human actions, as a rule, have their origin in Egoism, and
to it, accordingly, we must always first turn, when we try to find the
explanation of any given line of conduct; just as, when the endeavour
is made to guide a man in any direction, the means to this end are
universally calculated with reference to the same all-powerful motive.
Egoism is, from its nature, limitless. The individual is filled with
the unqualified desire of preserving his life, and of keeping it free
from all pain, under which is included all want and privation. He
wishes to have the greatest possible amount of pleasurable existence,
and every gratification that he is capable of appreciating; indeed,
he attempts, if possible, to evolve fresh capacities for enjoyment.
Everything that opposes the strivings of his Egoism awakens his
dislike, his anger, his hate: this is the mortal enemy, which he tries
to annihilate. If it were possible, he would like to possess everything
for his own pleasure; as this is impossible, he wishes at least to
control everything. "All things for me, and nothing for others" is his
maxim. Egoism is a huge giant overtopping the world. If each person
were allowed to choose between his own destruction and that of the
rest of mankind, I need not say what the decision would be in most
cases. Thus, it is that every human unit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> makes himself the centre of
the world, which he views exclusively from that standpoint. Whatever
occurs, even, for instance, the most sweeping changes in the destinies
of nations, he brings into relation first and foremost with his own
interests, which, however slightly and indirectly they may be affected,
he is sure to think of before anything else. No sharper contrast can
be imagined than that between the profound and exclusive attention
which each person devotes to his own self, and the indifference with
which, as a rule, all other people regard that self,&mdash;an indifference
precisely like that with which he in turn looks upon them. To a
certain extent it is actually comic to see how each individual out of
innumerable multitudes considers himself, at least from the practical
point of view, as the only real thing, and all others in some sort
as mere phantoms. The ultimate reason of this lies in the fact that
every one is <b>directly</b> conscious of himself, but of others only
<i>indirectly</i>, through his mind's eye; and the direct impression asserts
its right. In other words, it is in consequence of the subjectivity
which is essential to our consciousness that each person is himself
the whole world; for all that is objective exists only indirectly, as
simply the mental picture of the subject; whence it comes about that
everything is invariably expressed in terms of self-consciousness. The
only world which the individual really grasps, and of which he has
certain knowledge, he carries in himself, as a mirrored image fashioned
by his brain; and he is, therefore, its centre. Consequently he is all
in all to himself; and since he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> feels that he contains within his ego
all that is real, nothing can be of greater importance to him than his
own self.<a name="FNanchor_3_75" id="FNanchor_3_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_75" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Moreover this supremely important self, this microcosm,
to which the macrocosm stands in relation as its mere modification
or accident,&mdash;this, which is the individual's whole world, he knows
perfectly well must be destroyed by death; which is therefore for him
equivalent to the destruction of all things.</p>

<p>Such, then, are the elements out of which, on the basis of the Will to
live, Egoism grows up, and like a broad trench it forms a perennial
separation between man and man. If on any occasion some one actually
jumps across, to help another, such an act is regarded as a sort of
miracle, which calls forth amazement and wins approval. In Part II.,
Chapter VI., where Kant's principle of Morals is discussed, I had
the opportunity of describing how Egoism behaves in everyday life,
where it is always peering out of some corner or other, despite
ordinary politeness, which, like the traditional fig-leaf, is used
as a covering. In point of fact, politeness is the conventional and
systematic disavowal of Egoism in the trifles of daily intercourse,
and is, of course, a piece of recognised hypocrisy. Gentle manners are
expected and commended, because that which they conceal&mdash;Egoism&mdash;is so
odious, that no one wishes to see it, however much it is known to be
there; just as people like to have repulsive objects hidden at least by
a curtain. Now, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> external force (under which must be included
every source of fear whether of human or superhuman powers), or else
the real moral incentive is in effective operation, it is certain that
Egoism always pursues its purposes with unqualified directness; hence
without these checks, considering the countless number of egoistic
individuals, the <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i><a name="FNanchor_4_76" id="FNanchor_4_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_76" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> would be the order
of the day, and prove the ruin of all. Thus is explained the early
construction by reflecting reason of state government, which, arising,
as it does, from a mutual fear of reciprocal violence, obviates the
disastrous consequences of the general Egoism, as far as it is possible
to do by <b>negative</b> procedure. Where, however, the two forces
that oppose Egoism fail to be operative, the latter is not slow to
reveal all its horrible dimensions, nor is the spectacle exactly
attractive. In order to express the strength of this antimoral power
in a few words, to portray it, so to say, at one stroke, some very
emphatic hyperbole is wanted. It may be put thus: many a man would
be quite capable of killing another, simply to rub his boots over
with the victim's fat. I am only doubtful whether this, after all, is
any exaggeration. <b>Egoism</b>, then, is the first and principal,
though not the only, power that the <b>moral Motive</b> has to contend
against; and it is surely sufficiently clear that the latter, in order
to enter the lists against such an opponent, must be something more
real than a hair-splitting sophism or an <i>a priori</i> soap-bubble. In war
the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> thing to be done is to know the enemy well; and in the shock
of battle, now impending, <b>Egoism</b>, as the chief combatant on its
own side, is best set against the virtue of <b>Justice</b>, which, in
my opinion, is the first and original cardinal virtue.</p>

<p>The virtue of <b>loving-kindness</b>, on the other hand, is rather to
be matched with <b>ill-will</b>, or <b>spitefulness</b>, the origin
and successive stages of which we will now consider. Ill-will, in
its lower degrees, is very frequent, indeed, almost a common thing;
and it easily rises in the scale. Goethe is assuredly right when
he says that in this world indifference and aversion are quite at
home.&mdash;(<i>Wahlverwandtschaften,</i> Part I., chap. 3.) It is very fortunate
for us that the cloak, which prudence and politeness throw over this
vice, prevents us from seeing how general it is, and how the <i>bellum
omnium contra omnes</i> is constantly waged, at least in thought. Yet
ever and anon there is some appearance of it: for instance, in the
relentless backbiting so frequently observed; while its clearest
manifestation is found in all out-breaks of anger, which, for the most
part, are quite disproportional to their cause, and which could hardly
be so violent, had they not been compressed&mdash;like gunpowder&mdash;into the
explosive compound formed of long cherished brooding hatred. Ill-will
usually arises from the unavoidable collisions of Egoism which occur
at every step. It is, moreover, objectively excited by the view of
the weakness, the folly, the vices, failings, shortcomings, and
imperfections of all kinds, which every one more or less, at least
occasionally, affords to others. Indeed, the spectacle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> is such, that
many a man, especially in moments of melancholy and depression, may
be tempted to regard the world, from the aesthetic standpoint, as a
cabinet of caricatures; from the intellectual, as a madhouse; and
from the moral, as a nest of sharpers. If such a mental attitude be
indulged, misanthropy is the result. Lastly, one of the chief sources
of ill-will is envy; or rather, the latter is itself ill-will, kindled
by the happiness, possessions, or advantages of others. No one is
absolutely free from envy; and Herodotus (III. 80) said long ago:
<i>ϕθόνος ἀρχῆθεν ἐμϕύεται ἀνθρώπῳ</i> (envy is a natural growth in man from
the beginning). But its degrees vary considerably. It is most poisonous
and implacable when directed against personal qualities, because then
the envious have nothing to hope for. And precisely in such cases
its vilest form also appears, because men are made to hate what they
ought to love and honour. Yet so "the world wags," even as Petrarca
complained:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<i>Di lor par più, che d'altri, invidia s'abbia,</i><br />
<i>Che per se stessi son levati a volo,</i><br />
<i>Uscendo fuor della commune gabbia.</i><br />
(For envy fastens most of all on those,<br />
Who, rising on their own strong wings, escape<br />
The bars wherein the vulgar crowd is cag'd.)<br />
</p>

<p>The reader is referred to the Parerga, vol. ii., § 114, for a more
complete examination of envy.</p>

<p>In a certain sense the opposite of envy is the habit of gloating over
the misfortunes of others, At any rate, while the former is human, the
latter is diabolical. There is no sign more infallible of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> entirely
bad heart, and of profound moral worthlessness than open and candid
enjoyment in seeing other people suffer. The man in whom this trait is
observed ought to be for ever avoided: <i>Hic niger est, hunc tu, Romane,
caveto</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_77" id="FNanchor_5_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_77" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> These two vices are in themselves merely theoretical; in
practice they become malice and cruelty. It is true that Egoism may
lead to wickedness and crime of every sort; but the resulting injury
and pain to others are simply the means, not the end, and are therefore
involved only as an accident. Whereas malice and cruelty make others'
misery the end in itself, the realisation of which affords distinct
pleasure. They therefore constitute a higher degree of moral turpitude.
The maxim of Egoism, at its worst is: <i>Neminem juva, immo omnes, si
forte conducit</i> (thus there is always a condition), <i>laede</i> (help no
body, but rather injure all people, if it brings you any advantage).
The guiding rule of malice is: <i>Omnes, quantum potes, laede</i> (injure
all people as far as you can). As malicious joy is in fact theoretical
cruelty, so, conversely, cruelty is nothing but malicious joy put into
practice; and the latter is sure to show itself in the form of cruelty,
directly an opportunity offers.</p>

<p>An examination of the special vices that spring from these two primary
antimoral forces forms no part of the present treatise: its proper
place would be found in a detailed system of Ethics. From <b>Egoism</b>
we should probably derive greed, gluttony, lust, selfishness, avarice,
covetousness, injustice, hardness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> of heart, pride, arrogance, etc.;
while to <b>spitefulness</b> might be ascribed disaffection, envy,
ill-will, malice, pleasure in seeing others suffer, prying curiosity,
slander, insolence, petulance, hatred, anger, treachery, fraud, thirst
for revenge, cruelty, etc. The first root is more bestial, the second
more devilish; and according as either is the stronger; or according
as the moral incentive, to be described below, predominates, so
the salient points for the ethical classification of character are
determined. No man is entirely free from some traces of all three.</p>

<p>Here I bring to an end my review of these terrible powers of evil;
it is an array reminding one of the Princes of Darkness in Milton's
Pandemonium. But my plan, which in this respect of course differs from
that of all other moralists, required me to consider at the outset
this gloomy side of human nature, and, like Dante, to descend first to
Tartarus.</p>

<p>It will now be fully apparent how difficult our problem is. We have
to find a motive capable of making a man take up a line of conduct
directly opposed to all those propensities which lie deeply ingrained
in his nature; or, given such conduct as a fact of experience, we must
search for a motive capable of supplying an adequate and non-artificial
explanation of it. The difficulty, in fact, is so great that, in order
to solve it, for the vast majority of mankind, it has been everywhere
necessary to have recourse to machinery from another world. Gods have
been pointed to, whose will and command the required mode of behaviour
was said to be, and who were represented as emphasising this command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
by penalties and rewards either in this, or in another world, to
which death would be the gate. Now let us assume that belief in a
doctrine of this sort took general root (a thing which is certainly
possible through strenuous inculcation at a very early age); and let
us also assume that it brought about the intended effect,&mdash;though this
is a much harder matter to admit, and not nearly so well confirmed
by experience; we should then no doubt succeed in obtaining strict
legality of action, even beyond the limits that justice and the police
can reach; but every one feels that this would not in the least imply
what we mean by morality of the heart. For obviously, every act arising
from motives like those just mentioned is after all derived simply from
pure Egoism. How can I talk of unselfishness when I am enticed by a
promised guerdon, or deterred by a threatened punishment? A recompense
in another world, thoroughly believed in, must be regarded as a bill
of exchange, which is perfectly safe, though only payable at a very
distant date. It is thus quite possible that the profuse assurances,
which beggars so constantly make, that those, who relieve them, will
receive a thousandfold more for their gifts in the next world, may lead
many a miser to generous alms-giving; for such a one complacently views
the matter as a good investment of money, being perfectly convinced
that he will rise again as a Croesus. For the mass of mankind, it
will perhaps be always necessary to continue the appeal to incentives
of this nature, and we know that such is the teaching promulgated by
the different religions, which are in fact the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> <b>metaphysics of the
people</b>. Be it, however, observed in this connection that a man is
sometimes just as much in error as to the true motives that govern
his own acts, as he is with regard to those of others. Hence it is
certain that many persons, while they can only account to themselves
for their noblest actions by attributing them to motives of the kind
above described, are, nevertheless, really guided in their conduct by
far higher and purer incentives, though the latter may be much more
difficult to discover. They are doing, no doubt, out of direct love
of their neighbour, that which they can but explain as the command of
their God. On the other hand, Philosophy, in dealing with this, as with
all other problems, endeavours to extract the true and ultimate cause
of the given phaenomena from the disclosures which the nature itself
of man yields, and which, freed as they must be from all mythical
interpretation, from all religious dogmas, and transcendent hypostases,
she requires to see confirmed by external or internal experience. Now,
as our present task is a philosophical one, we must entirely disregard
all solutions conditioned by any religion; and I have here touched on
them merely in order to throw a stronger light on the magnitude of the
difficulty.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IVc" id="CHAPTER_IVc">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h3>CRITERION OF ACTIONS OF MORAL WORTH.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>There is first the empirical question to be settled, whether actions
of voluntary justice and unselfish loving-kindness, which are capable
of rising to nobleness and magnanimity, actually occur in experience.
Unfortunately, this inquiry cannot be decided altogether empirically,
because it is invariably only the act that experience gives, the
<b>incentives</b> not being apparent. Hence the possibility always
remains that an egoistic motive may have had weight in determining a
just or good deed. In a theoretical investigation like the present,
I shall not avail myself of the inexcusable trick of shifting the
matter on to the reader's conscience. But I believe there are few
people who have any doubt about the matter, and who are not convinced
from their own experience that just acts are often performed simply
and solely to prevent a man suffering from injustice. Most of as, I
do not hesitate to say, are persuaded that there are persons in whom
the principle of giving others their due seems to be innate, who
neither intentionally injure any one, nor unconditionally seek their
own advantage, but in considering themselves show regard also for the
rights of their neighbours; persons who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> when they undertake matters
involving reciprocal obligations, not only see that the other party
does his duty, but also that he gets his own, because it is really
against their will that any one, with whom they have to do, should be
shabbily treated. These are the men of true probity, the few <i>aequi</i>
(just) among the countless number of the <i>iniqui</i> (unjust). Such
people exist. Similarly, it will be admitted, I think, that many help
and give, perform services, and deny themselves, without having any
further intention in their hearts than that of assisting another, whose
distress they see. When Arnold von Winkelried exclaimed: "<i>Trüwen,
lieben Eidgenossen, wullt's minem Wip und Kinde gedenken</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_1_78" id="FNanchor_1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_78" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and then
clasped in his arms as many hostile spears as he could grasp; can any
one believe that he had some selfish purpose? I cannot. To cases of
voluntary justice, which cannot be denied without deliberate and wilful
trifling with facts, I have already drawn attention in Chapter II. of
this Part. Should any one, however, persist in refusing to believe that
such actions ever happen, then, according to his view, Ethics would
be a science without any real object, like Astrology and Alchemy, and
it would be waste of time to discuss its basis any further. With him,
therefore, I have nothing to do, and address myself to those who allow
that we are dealing with something more than an imaginary citation.</p>

<p>It is, then, only to conduct of the above kind that genuine moral worth
can be ascribed. Its special mark is that it rejects and excludes
the whole class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> of motives by which otherwise all human action is
prompted: I mean the <b>self-interested</b> motives, using the word in
its widest sense. Consequently the moral value of an act is lowered by
the disclosure of an accessory selfish incentive; while it is entirely
destroyed, if that incentive stood alone. The absence of all egoistic
motives is thus the <b>Criterion</b> of an action of moral value. It
may, no doubt, be objected that also acts of pure malice and cruelty
are not selfish.<a name="FNanchor_2_79" id="FNanchor_2_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_79" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But it is manifest that the latter cannot be
meant, since they are, in kind, the exact opposite of those now being
considered. If, however, the definition be insisted on in its strict
sense, then we may expressly except such actions, because of their
essential token&mdash;the compassing of others' suffering.</p>

<p>There is also another characteristic of conduct having real moral
worth, which is entirely internal and therefore less obvious. I allude
to the fact that it leaves behind a certain self-satisfaction which
is called the approval of conscience: just as, on the other hand,
injustice and unkindness, and still more malice and cruelty, involve
a secret self-condemnation. Lastly, there is an external, secondary,
and accidental sign that draws a clear line between the two classes.
Acts of the former kind win the approval and respect of disinterested
witnesses: those of the latter incur their disapproval and contempt.</p>

<p>Those actions that bear the stamp of moral value, so determined,
and admitted to be realities, constitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> the phaenomenon that lies
before us, and which we have to explain. We must accordingly search
out what it is that moves men to such conduct. If we succeed in our
investigation, we shall necessarily bring to light the true moral
incentive; and, as it is upon this that all ethical science must
depend, our problem will then be solved.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_Vc" id="CHAPTER_Vc">CHAPTER V.</a></h4>

<h3>STATEMENT AND PROOF OF THE ONLY TRUE MORAL INCENTIVE.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>The preceding considerations, which were unavoidably necessary in order
to clear the ground, now enable me to indicate the true incentive
which underlies all acts of real moral worth. The seriousness, and
indisputable genuineness, with which we shall find it is distinguished,
removes it far indeed from the hair-splittings, subtleties,
sophisms, assertions formulated out of airy nothings, and <i>a priori</i>
soap-bubbles, which all systems up to the present have tried to make
at once the source of moral conduct and the basis of Ethics. This
incentive I shall not put forward as an hypothesis to be accepted or
rejected, as one pleases; I shall actually <b>prove</b> that it is
the only possible one. But as this demonstration requires several
fundamental truths to be borne in mind, the reader's attention is first
called to certain propositions which we must presuppose, and which may
properly be considered as axioms; except the last two, which result
from the analysis contained in the preceding chapter, and in Part II.,
Chapter III.</p>

<p>(1) No action can take place without a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> motive; as little as
a stone can move without a sufficient push or pull.</p>

<p>(2) Similarly, no action can be left undone, when, given the character
of the doer, a sufficient motive is present; unless a stronger
counter-motive necessarily prevents it.</p>

<p>(3) Whatever moves the Will,&mdash;this, and this alone, implies the sense
of weal and woe, in the widest sense of the term; and conversely, weal
and woe signify "that which is in conformity with, or which is contrary
to, a Will." Hence every motive must have a connection with weal and
woe.</p>

<p>(4) Consequently every action stands in relation to, and has as its
ultimate object, a being susceptible of weal and woe.</p>

<p>(5) This being is either the doer himself; or another, whose position
as regards the action is therefore <b>passive</b>; since it is done
either to his harm, or to his benefit and advantage.</p>

<p>(6) Every action, which has to do, as its ultimate object, with the
weal and woe of the agent himself, is <b>egoistic</b>.</p>

<p>(7) The foregoing propositions with regard to what is done apply
equally to what is left undone, in all cases where motive and
counter-motive play their parts.</p>

<p>(8) From the analysis in the foregoing chapter, it results that
<b>Egoism</b> and the <b>moral worth</b> of an action absolutely
exclude each other. If an act have an <b>egoistic</b> object as its
motive, then no moral value can be attached to it; if an act is to
have moral value, then no egoistic object, direct or indirect, near or
remote, may be its motive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>(9) In consequence of my elimination in Part II., Chapter III., of
alleged duties towards ourselves, the moral significance of our conduct
can only lie in the effect produced upon others; its relation to the
latter is alone that which lends it moral worth, or worthlessness, and
constitutes it an act of justice, loving-kindness, etc., or the reverse.</p>

<p>From these propositions the following conclusion is obvious: The
<b>weal and woe</b>, which (according to our third axiom) must, as its
ultimate object, lie at the root of everything done, or left undone,
is either that of the doer himself, or that of some other person,
whose <i>rôle</i> with reference to the action is passive. Conduct in the
first case is necessarily <b>egoistic</b>, as it is impelled by an
interested motive. And this is not only true when men&mdash;as they nearly
always do&mdash;plainly shape their acts for their own profit and advantage;
it is equally true when from anything done we expect some benefit to
ourselves, no matter how remote, whether in this or in another world.
Nor is it less the fact when our honour, our good name, or the wish
to win the respect of some one, the sympathy of the lookers on, etc.,
is the object we have in view; or when our intention is to uphold a
rule of conduct, which, if generally followed, would occasionally be
useful to ourselves, for instance, the principle of justice, of mutual
succour and aid, and so forth. Similarly, the proceeding is at bottom
egoistic, when a man considers it a prudent step to obey some absolute
command issued by an unknown, but evidently supreme power; for in such
a case nothing can be the motive but <b>fear</b> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> the disastrous
consequences of disobedience, however generally and indistinctly these
may be conceived. Nor is it a whit the less Egoism that prompts us
when we endeavour to emphasise, by something done or left undone,
the high opinion (whether distinctly realised or not) which we have
of ourselves, and of our value or dignity; for the diminution of
self-satisfaction, which might otherwise occur, would involve the
wounding of our pride. Lastly, it is still Egoism that is operative,
when a man, following Wolff's principles, seeks by his conduct to work
out his own perfection. In short, one may make the ultimate incentive
to an action what one pleases; it will always turn out, no matter by
how circuitous a path, that in the last resort what affects the actual
weal and woe of the agent himself is the real motive; consequently what
he does is <b>egoistic</b>, and therefore <b>without moral worth</b>.
There is only a single case in which this fails to happen: namely,
when the ultimate incentive for doing something, or leaving it undone,
is precisely and exclusively centred in the weal and woe of some one
else, who plays a passive part; that is to say, when the person on the
active side, by what he does, or omits to do, simply and solely regards
the weal and woe of another, and has absolutely no other object than
to benefit him, by keeping harm from his door, or, it may be, even
by affording help, assistance, and relief. It is this aim alone that
gives to what is done, or left undone, the stamp of moral worth; which
is thus seen to depend exclusively on the circumstance that the act
is carried out, or omitted, purely for the benefit and advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> of
another. If and when this is not so, then the question of weal and woe
which incites to, or deters from, every action contemplated, can only
relate to the agent himself; whence its performance, or non-performance
is entirely egoistic, and without moral value.</p>

<p>But if what I do is to take place solely on account of some one else;
then it follows that <b>his</b> weal and woe must directly constitute
<b>my</b> motive; just is, ordinarily, <b>my own</b> weal and woe
form it. This narrows the limits of our problem, which may now be
stated as follows: How is it possible that another's weal and woe
should influence my will directly, that is, exactly in the same way
as otherwise my own move it? How can that which affects another for
good or bad become my immediate motive, and actually sometimes assume
such importance that it more or less supplants my own interests, which
are, as a rule, the single source of the incentives that appeal to me?
Obviously, only because that other person becomes the ultimate object
of my will, precisely as usually I myself am that object; in other
words, because I directly desire weal, and not woe, for him, just as
habitually I do for myself. This, however, necessarily implies that I
suffer with him, and feel his woe, exactly as in most cases I feel only
mine, and therefore desire his weal as immediately as at other times I
desire only my own. But, for this to be possible, I must in some way
or other be <b>identified</b> with him; that is, the <b>difference</b>
between myself and him, which is the precise <i>raison d'être</i> of my
Egoism, must be <b>removed</b>, at least to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> extent. Now,
since I do not live in his skin, there remains only the knowledge, that
is, the mental picture, I have of him, as the possible means whereby
I can so far identify myself with him, that my action declares the
difference to be practically effaced. The process here analysed is not
a dream, a fancy floating in the air; it is perfectly real, and by
no means infrequent. It is, what we see every day,&mdash;the phaenomenon
of <b>Compassion</b>; in other words, the direct participation,
independent of all ulterior considerations, in the sufferings of
another, leading to sympathetic assistance in the effort to prevent
or remove them; whereon in the last resort all satisfaction and all
well-being and happiness depend. It is this Compassion alone which is
the real basis of all <b>voluntary</b> justice and all <b>genuine</b>
loving-kindness. Only so far as an action springs therefrom, has it
moral value; and all conduct that proceeds from any other motive
whatever has none. When once compassion is stirred within me, by
another's pain, then his weal and woe go straight to my heart, exactly
in the same way, if not always to the same degree, as otherwise I feel
only my own. Consequently the difference between myself and him is no
longer an absolute one.</p>

<p>No doubt this operation is astonishing, indeed hardly comprehensible.
It is, in fact, the great mystery of Ethics, its original phaenomenon,
and the boundary stone, past which only transcendental speculation
may dare to take a step. Herein we see the wall of partition,
which, according to the light of nature (as reason is called by old
theologians), entirely separates being from being, broken down, and
the non-ego to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> a certain extent identified with the ego. I wish
for the moment to leave the metaphysical explanation of this enigma
untouched, and first to inquire whether all acts of voluntary justice
and true loving-kindness really arise from it. If so, our problem will
be solved, for we shall have found the ultimate basis of morality, and
shown that it lies in human nature itself. This foundation, however,
in its turn cannot form a problem of Ethics, but rather, like every
other ultimate fact as such, of Metaphysics. Only the solution, that
the latter offers of the primary ethical phaenomenon, lies outside
the limits of the question put by the Danish Royal Society, which is
concerned solely with the basis; so that the transcendental explanation
can be given merely as a voluntary and unessential appendix.</p>

<p>But before I turn to the derivation of the Cardinal virtues from
the original incentive, as here disclosed, I have still to bring to
the notice of the reader two observations which the subject renders
necessary.</p>

<p>(1) For the purpose of easier comprehension I have simplified the
above presentation of compassion as the sole source of truly moral
actions, by intentionally leaving out of consideration the incentive
of <b>Malice</b>, which while it is equally useless to the self as
compassion, makes the <b>pain</b> of others its ultimate purpose. We
are now, however, in a position, by including it, to state the above
proof more completely, and rigorously, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are only <b>three</b> fundamental springs of human conduct, and
all possible motives arise from one or other of these. They are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Egoism; which desires the weal of the self, and is limitless.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Malice; which desires the woe of others, and may develop to the
utmost cruelty.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Compassion; which desires the weal of others, and may rise to
nobleness and magnanimity.</p>

<p>Every human act is referable to one of these springs; although two of
them may work together. Now, as we have assumed that actions of moral
worth are in point of fact realities; it follows that they also must
proceed from one of these primal sources. But, by the eighth axiom,
they cannot arise from the first, and still less from the second; since
all conduct springing from the latter is morally worthless, while the
offshoots of the former are in part neither good nor bad in themselves.
Hence they must have their origin in the third incentive; and this will
be established <i>a posteriori</i> in the sequel.</p>

<p>(2) Direct sympathy with another is limited to his sufferings, and is
not immediately awakened by his well-being: the latter <i>per se</i> leaves
us indifferent. J. J. Rousseau in his <i>Émile</i> (Bk. IV.) expresses the
same view: "<i>Première maxime: il n'est pas dans le cœur humain, de
se mettre à la place des gens, qui sont plus heureux que nous, mais
seulement de ceux, qui sont plus à plaindre</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_1_80" id="FNanchor_1_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_80" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> etc.</p>

<p>The reason of this is that pain or suffering, which includes all
want, privation, need, indeed every wish, is <b>positive</b>, and
works <b>directly</b> on the consciousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> Whereas the nature of
satisfaction, of enjoyment, of happiness, and the like, consists solely
in the fact that a hardship is done away with, a pain lulled: whence
their effect is <b>negative</b>. We thus see why need or desire is the
condition of every pleasure. Plato understood this well enough, and
only excepted sweet odours, and intellectual enjoyment. (<i>De Rep.,</i>
IX., p. 264 sq., edit. Bipont.)<a name="FNanchor_2_81" id="FNanchor_2_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_81" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And Voltaire says: "<i>Il n'est pas
de vrais plaisirs, qu'avec de vrais besoins</i>."<a name="FNanchor_3_82" id="FNanchor_3_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_82" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Pain, then, is
<b>positive</b>, and makes itself known by itself: satisfaction or
pleasure is <b>negative</b>&mdash;simply the removal of the former. This
principle explains the fact that only the suffering, the want, the
danger, the helplessness of another awakens our sympathy directly
and as such. The lucky or contented man, <b>as such</b>, leaves us
indifferent&mdash;in reality because his state is negative; he is without
pain, indigence, or distress. We may of course take pleasure in the
success, the well-being, the enjoyment of others: but if we do, it is
a secondary pleasure, and caused by our having previously sorrowed
over their sufferings and privations. Or else we share the joy and
happiness of a man, not <b>as such</b>, but because, and in so far as,
he is our child, father, friend, relation, servant, subject, etc. In a
word, the good fortune, or pleasure of another, <b>purely as such</b>,
does not arouse in us the same direct sympathy as is certainly elicited
by his misfortune, privation, or misery, <b>purely as such</b>. If
even on <b>our own behalf</b> it is only suffering (under which must
be reckoned all wants, needs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> wishes, and even ennui) that stirs our
activity; and if contentment and prosperity fill us with indolence and
lazy repose; why should it not be the same when others are concerned?
For (as we have seen) our sympathy rests on an identification of
ourselves with them. Indeed, the sight of success and enjoyment,
<b>purely as such</b>, is very apt to raise the envy, to which every
man is prone, and which has its place among the antimoral forces
enumerated above.</p>

<p>In connection with the exposition of Compassion here given, as the
coming into play of motives directly occasioned by another's calamity,
I take the opportunity of condemning the mistake of Cassina,<a name="FNanchor_4_83" id="FNanchor_4_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_83" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which
has been so often repeated. His view is that compassion arises from
a sudden hallucination, which makes us put ourselves in the place
of the sufferer, and then imagine that we are undergoing <b>his</b>
pain in <b>own own person</b>. This is not in the least the case. The
conviction never leaves us for a moment that he is the sufferer, not
we; and it is precisely in his person, not in ours, that we feel the
distress which afflicts us. We suffer <b>with</b> him, and therefore in
him; we feel his trouble as <b>his</b>, and are not under the delusion
that it is ours; indeed, the happier we are, the greater the contrast
between our own state and his, the more we are open to the promptings
of Compassion. The explanation of the possibility of this extraordinary
phaenomenon is, however, not so easy; nor is it to be reached by the
path of pure psychology, as Cassina supposed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> key can be furnished
by Metaphysics alone; and this I shall attempt to give in the last Part
of the present treatise.</p>

<p>I now turn to consider the derivation of actions of real moral worth
from the source which has been indicated. The general rule by which to
test such conduct, and which, consequently, is the leading principle
of Ethics, I have already enlarged upon in the foregoing Part, and
enunciated as follows: <i>Neminem laede; immo omnes, quantum potes,
juva.</i> (Do harm to no one; but rather help all people, as far as lies
in your power.) As this formula contains two clauses, so the actions
corresponding to it fall naturally into two classes.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_VIc" id="CHAPTER_VIc">CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<h3>THE VIRTUE OF JUSTICE.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>If we look more closely at this process called Compassion, which we
have shown to be the primary ethical phaenomenon, we remark at once
that there are two distinct degrees in which another's suffering may
become directly my motive, that is, may urge me to do something, or
to leave it undone. The first degree of Compassion is seen when,
by counter-acting egoistic and malicious motives, it keeps me from
bringing pain on another, and from becoming myself the cause of
trouble, which so far does not exist. The other higher degree is
manifested, when it works positively, and incites me to active help.
The distinction between the so-called duties of law and duties of
virtue, better described as justice and loving-kindness, which was
effected by Kant in such a forced and artificial manner, here results
entirely of itself; whence the correctness of the principle is
attested. It is the natural, unmistakable, and sharp separation between
negative and positive, between doing no harm, and helping. The terms in
common use&mdash;namely, "the duties of law," and "the duties of virtue,"
(the latter being also called "duties of love," or "imperfect duties,")
are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> first place faulty because they co-ordinate the <i>genus</i>
with the <i>species</i>; for justice is one of the virtues. And next, they
owe their origin to the mistake of giving a much too wide extension to
the idea "Duty"; which I shall reduce to its proper limits below. In
place, therefore, of these duties I put two virtues; the one, justice,
and the other, loving-kindness; and I name them cardinal virtues,
since from them all others not only in fact proceed, but also may be
theoretically derived.... Both have their root in natural Compassion.
And this Compassion is an undeniable fact of human consciousness,
is an essential part of it, and does not depend on assumptions,
conceptions, religions, dogmas, myths, training, and education. On
the contrary, it is original and immediate, and lies in human nature
itself. It consequently remains unchanged under all circumstances, and
reveals itself in every land, and at all times. This is why appeal is
everywhere confidently made to it, as to something necessarily present
in every man; and it is never an attribute of the "strange gods." <a name="FNanchor_1_84" id="FNanchor_1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_84" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
As he, who appears to be without compassion, is called inhuman; so
"humanity" is often used as its synonyme.</p>

<p>The first degree, then, in which this natural and genuine moral
incentive shows itself is only <b>negative</b>. Originally we are all
disposed to injustice and violence, because our need, our desire, our
anger and hate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> pass into the consciousness directly, and hence have
the <i>Jus primi occupantis</i>. (The right of the first occupant.) Whereas
the sufferings of others, caused by our injustice and violence, enter
the consciousness indirectly, that is, by the secondary channel of a
mental picture, and not till they are understood by experience. Thus
Seneca (<i>Ep.</i> 50) says: <i>Ad neminem ante bona mens venit, quam mala</i>.
(Good feelings never come before bad ones.) In its first degree,
therefore, Compassion opposes and baffles the design to which I am
urged by the antimoral forces dwelling within me, and which will bring
trouble on a fellow-being. It calls out to me: "Stop!" and encircles
the other as with a fence, so as to protect him from the injury which
otherwise my egoism or malice would lead me to inflict on him. So
arises out of this first degree of compassion the rule: <i>Neminem
laede</i>. (Do harm to no one.) This is the fundamental principle of the
virtue of justice, and here alone is to be found its origin, pure and
simple,&mdash;an origin which is truly moral, and free from all extraneous
admixture. Otherwise derived, justice would have to rest on Egoism,&mdash;a
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. If my nature is susceptible of Compassion up
to this point, then it will avail to keep me back, whenever I should
like to use others' pain as a means to obtain my ends; equally, whether
this pain be immediate, or an after-consequence, whether it be effected
directly, or indirectly, through intermediate links. I shall therefore
lay hands on the property as little as on the person of another, and
avoid causing him distress, no less mental than bodily. I shall thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
not only abstain from doing him physical injury, but also, with equal
care I shall guard against inflicting on him the suffering of mind,
which mortification and calumny, anxiety and vexation so surely work.
The same sense of Compassion will check me from gratifying my desires
at the cost of women's happiness for life, or from seducing another
man's wife, or from ruining youths morally and physically by tempting
them to <i>paederastia</i>. Not that it is at all necessary in each single
case that Compassion should be definitely excited; indeed it would
often come too late; but rather the rule: <i>Neminem laede</i>, is formed by
noble minds out of the knowledge, gained once for all, of the injury
which every unjust act necessarily entails upon others, and which is
aggravated by the feeling of having to endure wrong through a <i>force
majeure</i>. Such natures are led by reflecting reason to carry out this
principle with unswerving resolution. They respect the rights of every
man, and abstain from all encroachment on them; they keep themselves
free from self-reproach, by refusing to be the cause of others'
trouble; they do not shift on to shoulders not their own, by force or
by trickery, the burdens and sorrows of life, which circumstances bring
to every one; they prefer to bear themselves the portions allotted
to them, so as not to double those of their neighbours. For although
generalising formulae, and abstract knowledge of whatever kind, are
not in the least the cause, or the real basis of morality; these are
nevertheless indispensable for a moral course of life. They are the
cistern or reservoir, in which the habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> of mind, that springs from
the fount of all morality (a fount not at all moments flowing), may
be stored up, thence to be drawn off, as occasion requires. There is
thus an analogy between things moral and things physiological; among
many instances of which we need only mention that of the gall-bladder,
which is used for keeping the secretion of the liver. Without
firmly held principles we should inevitably be at the mercy of the
antimoral incentives, directly they are roused to activity by external
influences; and <b>self-control</b> lies precisely in steadfast
adherence and obedience to such principles, despite the motives which
oppose them.</p>

<p>In general, the feminine half of humanity is inferior to the
masculine in the virtue of justice, and its derivatives, uprightness,
conscientiousness, etc.; the explanation is found in the fact that,
owing to the weakness of its reasoning powers the former is much less
capable than the latter of understanding and holding to general laws,
and of taking them as a guiding thread. Hence injustice and falseness
are women's besetting sins, and lies their proper element. On the
other hand, they surpass men in the virtue of loving-kindness; because
usually the stimulus to this is <b>intuitive</b>, and consequently
appeals directly to the sense of Compassion, of which females are
much more susceptible than males. For the former nothing but what
is intuitive, present, and immediately real has a true existence;
that which is knowable only by means of concepts, as for instance,
the absent, the distant, the past, the future, they do not readily
grasp. We thus find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> compensation here, as in so much else; justice
is more the masculine, loving-kindness more the feminine virtue.
The mere idea of seeing women sitting on the judges' bench raises a
smile; but the sisters of mercy far excel the brothers of charity.
Now animals, as they have no power of gaining knowledge by reason,
that is, of forming abstract ideas, are entirely incapable of fixed
resolutions, to say nothing of principles; they consequently totally
lack <b>self-control</b>, and are helplessly given over to external
impressions and internal impulses. This is why they have no conscious
morality; although the different species show great contrasts of good
and evil in their characters, and as regards the highest races these
are traceable even in individuals.</p>

<p>From the foregoing considerations we see that in the single acts of
the just man Compassion works only indirectly through his formulated
principles, and not so much <i>actu</i> as <i>potentiâ</i>; much in the same way
as in statics the greater length of one of the scale-beams, owing to
its greater power of motion, balances the smaller weight attached to
it with the larger on the other side, and works, while at rest, only
<i>potentiâ,</i> not <i>actu</i>; yet with the same efficiency.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Compassion is always ready to pass into active operation.
Therefore, whenever, in special cases, the established rule shows signs
of breaking down, the one incentive (for we exclude of course those
based on Egoism), which is capable of infusing fresh life into it, is
that drawn from the fountain-head itself&mdash;Compassion. This is true
not only where it is a question of personal violence, but also where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
property is concerned, for instance, when any one feels the desire to
keep some valuable object which he has found. In such cases,&mdash;if we set
aside all motives prompted by worldly wisdom, and by religion&mdash;nothing
brings a man back so easily to the path of justice, as the realisation
of the trouble, the grief, the lamentation of the loser. It is because
this is felt to be true, that, when publicity is given to the loss of
money, the assurance is so often added that the loser is a poor man, a
servant, etc.</p>

<p>It is hoped that these considerations have made it clear that, however
contrary appearances may be at first sight, yet undoubtedly justice, as
a genuine and voluntary virtue has its origin in Compassion. But if any
one should suppose such a soil too barren and meagre to bear this great
cardinal virtue, let him reflect on what is said above, and remember
how small is the amount of true, spontaneous, unselfish, unfeigned
justice among men; how the real thing only occurs as a surprising
exception, and how, to its counterfeit,&mdash;the justice that rests on mere
worldly wisdom and is everywhere published abroad&mdash;it is related, both
in quality and quantity, as gold is to copper. I should like to call
the one <i>δικαιοσύνη πάνδημος</i> (common, ordinary justice), the other
<i>οὐρανία</i> (heavenly justice).<a name="FNanchor_2_85" id="FNanchor_2_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_85" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For the latter is she, who, according
to Hesiod,<a name="FNanchor_3_86" id="FNanchor_3_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_86" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> leaves the earth in the iron age, to dwell with the
celestial gods. To produce such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> rare exotic as this the root we have
indicated is surely vigorous enough.</p>

<p>It will now be seen that <b>injustice</b> or <b>wrong</b> always
consists in <b>working harm</b> on another. Therefore the conception of
wrong is <b>positive</b>, and antecedent to the conception of right,
which is <b>negative</b>, and simply denotes the actions performable
without injury to others; in other words, without wrong being done.
That to this class belongs also whatever is effected with no other
object than that of warding off from oneself meditated mischief is
an easy inference. For no participation in another's interests, and
no sympathy for him, can require me to let myself be harmed by him,
that is, to undergo wrong. The theory that right is negative, in
contradistinction to wrong as positive, we find supported by Hugo
Grotius, the father of philosophical jurisprudence. The definition of
justice which he gives at the beginning of his work, <i>De Jure Belli et
Pacis</i> (Bk. I., chap. 1., § 3), runs as follows:&mdash;<i>Jus hic nihil aliud,
quam quod justum est, significant, idque negante magis sensu, quam
aiente, ut jus sit, quod injustum non est.</i><a name="FNanchor_4_87" id="FNanchor_4_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_87" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The negative character
of justice is also established, little as it may appear, even by the
familiar formula: "Give to each one his own." Now, there is no need
to give a man his own, if he has it. The real meaning is therefore:
"Take from none his own." Since the requirements of justice are only
negative, they may be effected by coercion; for the <i>Neminem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> laede</i>
can be practised by all alike. The coercive apparatus is the state,
whose sole <i>raison d'être</i> is to protect its subjects, individually
from each other, and collectively from external foes. It is true that
a few German would-be philosophers of this venal age wish to distort
the state into an institution for the spread of morality, education,
and edifying instruction. But such a view contains, lurking in the
background, the Jesuitical aim of doing away with personal freedom
and individual development, and of making men mere wheels in a huge
Chinese governmental and religious machine. And this is the road that
once led to Inquisitions, to Autos-da-fé, and religious wars. Frederick
the Great showed that he at least never wished to tread it, when he
said: "In my land every one shall care for his own salvation, as he
himself thinks best." Nevertheless, we still see everywhere (with the
more apparent than real exception of North America) that the state
undertakes to provide for the metaphysical needs of its members. The
governments appear to have adopted as their guiding principle the tenet
of Quintus Curtius: <i>Nulla res efficacius multitudinem regit, quam
superstitio: alioquin impotens, saeva, mutabilis; ubi vana religione
capta est, melius vatibus, quam ducibus suis paret.</i><a name="FNanchor_5_88" id="FNanchor_5_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_88" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that "wrong" and "right" are convertible synonymes of "to
do harm" and "to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> refrain from doing it," and that under "right" is
included the warding off of injury from oneself. It will be obvious
that these conceptions are independent of, and antecedent to, all
positive legislation. There is, therefore, a pure ethical right, or
natural right, and a pure doctrine of right, detached from all positive
statutes. The first principles of this doctrine have no doubt an
empirical origin, so far as they arise from the idea of harm done,
but <i>per se</i> they rest on the pure understanding, which <i>a priori</i>
furnishes ready to hand the axiom: <i>causa causae est causa effectus</i>.
(The cause of a cause is the cause of the effect.) Taken in this
connection the words mean: if any one desires to injure me, it is
not I, but he, that is the cause of whatever I am obliged to do in
self-defence; and I can consequently oppose all encroachments on his
part, without wronging him. Here we have, so to say, a law of moral
repercussion. Thus it comes about that the union of the empirical idea
of injury done with the axiom supplied by the pure understanding, gives
rise to the fundamental conceptions of wrong and right, which every one
grasps <i>a priori</i>, and learns by actual trial to immediately adopt.
The empiric, who denies this, and refuses to accept anything but the
verdict of experience, may be referred to the testimony of the savage
races, who all distinguish between wrong and right quite correctly,
often indeed with nice precision; as is strikingly manifested when
they are engaged in bartering and other transactions with Europeans,
or visit their ships. They are bold and self-assured, when they are in
the right; but uneasy, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> know they are wrong. In disputes a
just settlement satisfies them, whereas unjust procedure drives them to
war. The Doctrine of Eight is a branch of Ethics, whose function is to
determine those actions which may not be performed, unless one wishes
to injure others, that is, to be guilty of wrong-doing; and here the
<b>active</b> part played is kept in view. But legislation applies this
chapter of moral science conversely, that is, with reference to the
<b>passive</b> side of the question, and declares that the same actions
need not be endured, since no one ought to have wrong inflicted on him.
To frustrate such conduct the state constructs the complete edifice
of the law, as positive Right. Its intention is that no one shall
<b>suffer</b> wrong; the intention of the Doctrine of Moral Right is
that no one shall <b>do</b> wrong.<a name="FNanchor_6_89" id="FNanchor_6_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_89" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>If by unjust action I molest some one, whether in his person,
his freedom, his property, or his honour, the wrong as regards
<b>quality</b> remains the same. But with respect to <b>quantity</b>
it may vary very much. This difference in the amount of wrong effected
appears not to have been as yet investigated by moralists, although it
is everywhere recognised in real life, because the censure passed is
always proportional to the harm inflicted. So also with just actions,
the right done is constant in quality, but not in quantity. To explain
this better: he, who when dying of starvation steals a loaf, commits
a wrong; but how small is this wrong in comparison with the act of an
opulent proprietor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> who, in whatever way, despoils a poor man of his
last penny! Again: the rich person who pays his hired labourer, acts
justly; but how insignificant is this piece of justice when contrasted
with that of a penniless toiler, who voluntarily returns to its wealthy
owner a purse of gold which he has found! The measure, however, of this
striking difference in the quantity of justice, and injustice (the
<b>quality</b> being always constant), is not direct and absolute, as
on a graduated scale; it is indirect and relative, like the ratio of
sines and tangents. I give therefore the following definition: the
amount of injustice in my conduct varies as the amount of evil, which
I thereby bring on another, divided by the amount of advantage, which
I myself gain; and the amount of justice in my conduct varies as the
amount of advantage, which injury done to another brings me, divided by
the amount of harm which he thereby suffers.</p>

<p>We have further to notice a <b>double</b> form of injustice which is
specifically different from the simple kind, be it never so great. This
variety may be detected by the fact that the amount of indignation
shown by disinterested witnesses, which is always proportional to the
amount of wrong inflicted, never reaches the <b>maximum</b> except
when it is present. We then see how the deed is loathed, as something
revolting and heinous, as an <i>ἄγος</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, abomination), before
which, as it were, the gods veil their faces. <b>Double</b> injustice
occurs when some one, after definitely undertaking the obligation of
protecting his friend, master, client, etc., in a special way, not
only is guilty of non-fulfilment of that duty (which of itself would
be injurious to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> other, and therefore a wrong); but when, in
addition, he turns round, and attacks the man, and strikes at the very
spot which he promised to guard. Instances are: the appointed watch,
or guide, who becomes an assassin; the trusted caretaker, who becomes
a thief; the guardian, who robs his ward of her property; the lawyer,
who prevaricates; the judge, who is corruptible; the adviser, who
deliberately gives some fatal counsel. All such conduct is known by the
name of <b>treachery</b>, and is viewed with abhorrence by the whole
world. Hence Dante puts traitors in the lowest circle of Hell, where
Satan himself is found (<i>Inferno</i>: xi, 61-60).</p>

<p>As we have here had occasion to mention the word "obligation," this
is the place to determine the conception of <b>Duty</b>, which is so
often spoken of both in Ethics and in real life, but with too wide
an extension of meaning. We have seen that wrong always signifies
injury done to another, whether it be in his person, his freedom, his
property, or his honour. The consequence appears to be that every wrong
must imply a positive aggression, and so a definite act. Only there are
actions, the simple omission of which constitutes a wrong; and these
are Duties. This is the true philosophic definition of the conception
"Duty,"&mdash;a term which loses its characteristic note, and hence becomes
valueless, if it is used (as hitherto it has been in Moral Science)
to designate all praiseworthy conduct. It is forgotten that "Duty"<a name="FNanchor_7_90" id="FNanchor_7_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_90" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
necessarily means a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> <b>debt</b> which is owing, being thus an action,
by the simple omission of which another suffers harm, that is, a wrong
comes about. Clearly in this case the injury only takes place through
the person, who neglects the duty, having distinctly pledged or bound
himself to it. Consequently all duties depend on an obligation which
has been entered into. This, as a rule, takes the form of a definite,
if sometimes tacit, agreement between two parties: as for instance,
between prince and people, government and its servants, master and
man, lawyer and client, physician and patient; in a word, between any
and every one who undertakes to perform some task, and his employer
in the widest sense of the word. Hence every duty involves a right;
since no one undertakes an obligation without a motive, which means,
in this case, without seeing some advantage for himself. There is
only <b>one</b> obligation that I know of which is not subject to an
agreement, but arises directly and solely through an act; this is
because one of the persons with whom it has to do was not in existence
when it was contracted. I refer to the duty of parents towards their
children. Whoever brings a child into the world, has incumbent on him
the duty of supporting his offspring, until the latter is able to
maintain himself; and should this time never come, owing to incapacity
from blindness, deformity, cretinism, and the like, neither does the
duty ever come to an end. It is clear that merely by failing to provide
for the needs of his son, that is, by a simple omission, the father
would injure him, indeed jeopardise his life. Children's duty towards
their parents is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> not so direct and imperative. It rests on the fact
that, as every duty involves a right, parents also must have some just
claim on their issue. This is the foundation of the duty of filial
obedience, which, however, in course of time ceases simultaneously
with the right out of which it sprang. It is replaced by gratitude for
that which was done by father and mother over and above their strict
duty. Nevertheless, although ingratitude is a hateful, often indeed a
revolting vice, gratitude cannot be called a <b>duty</b>; because its
omission inflicts no injury on the other side, and is therefore no
<b>wrong</b>. Otherwise we should have to suppose that in his heart
of hearts the benefactor aims at making a good bargain. It should be
noticed that reparation made for harm done may also be regarded as a
duty arising directly through an action. This, however, is something
purely negative, as it is nothing but an attempt to remove and blot out
the consequences of an unjust deed, as a thing that ought never to have
taken place. Be it also observed that equity<a name="FNanchor_8_91" id="FNanchor_8_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_91" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is the foe of justice,
and often comes into harsh collision with it; so that the former ought
only to be admitted within certain limits. The German is a friend of
equity, while the Englishman holds to justice.</p>

<p>The law of motivation is just as strict as that of physical causality,
and hence involves the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> irresistible necessity. Consequently
wrong may be compassed not only by violence, but also by cunning. If
by violence I am able to kill or rob another, or compel him to obey
me, I can equally use cunning to accomplish the same ends; that is, I
can place false motives before his intellect, by reason of which he
must do what otherwise he would not. These false motives are effected
by lies. In reality lies are unjustifiable solely in so far as they
are instruments of cunning, in other words, of compulsion, by means of
motivation.<a name="FNanchor_9_92" id="FNanchor_9_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_92" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And this is precisely their function, as a rule. For,
in the first place, I cannot tell a falsehood without a motive, and
this motive will certainly be, with the rarest exceptions, an unjust
one; namely, the intention of holding others, over whom I have no
power, under my will, that is, of coercing them through the agency of
motivation. Also in mere exaggerations and untruthful bombast there
is the same purpose at work; for, by employing such language, a man
tries to place himself higher in the sight of others than is his due.
The binding force of a promise or a compact is contained in the fact
that, if it be not observed, it is a deliberate lie, pronounced in the
most solemn manner,&mdash;a lie, whose intention (that of putting others
under moral compulsion) is, in this case, all the clearer, because
its motive, the desired performance of something on the other side,
is expressly declared. The contemptible part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> fraud is that
hypocrisy is used to disarm the victim before he is attacked. The
highest point of villainy is reached in <b>treachery</b>, which, as we
have seen, is a <b>double</b> injustice, and is always, regarded with
loathing.</p>

<p>It is, then, obvious that, just as I am not wrong, that is, right in
resisting violence by violence, so where violence is not feasible,
or it appears more convenient, I am at liberty to resort to cunning;
accordingly, whenever I am entitled to use force, I may, if I please,
employ falsehood; for instance, against robbers and miscreants of
every sort, whom in this way I entice into a trap. Hence a promise
which is extorted by violence is not binding. But, as a matter of
fact, the right to avail myself of lies extends further. It occurs
whenever an unjustifiable question is asked, which has to do with my
private, or business affairs, and is hence prompted by curiosity; for
to answer it, or even to put it off by the suspicion-awakening words,
"I can't tell you," would expose me to danger. Here an untruth is
the indispensable weapon against unwarranted inquisitiveness, whose
motive is hardly ever a well-meaning one. For, just as I have the
right to oppose the apparent bad will of another, and to anticipate
with physical resistance, to the danger of my would-be aggressor, the
physical violence presumably thence resulting; so that, for instance,
as a precaution, I can protect my garden wall with sharp spikes, let
loose savage dogs in my court at night, and even, if circumstances
require it, set man-traps and spring-guns, for the evil consequences of
which the burglar has only himself to thank:&mdash;if I have the right to do
this, then I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> equally authorised in keeping secret, at any price,
that which, if known, would lay me bare to the attack of others. And I
have good reason for acting thus, because, in moral, no less than in
physical, relations, I am driven to assume that the bad will of others
is very possible, and must therefore take all necessary preventive
measures beforehand. Whence Ariosto says:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%;">
<i>Quantunque il similar sia le più volte</i><br />
<i>Ripreso, e dia di mala mente indict,</i><br />
<i>Si trova pure in molte cose e molte</i><br />
<i>Avere fatti evidenti benefici,</i><br />
<i>E danni e biasmi e morti avere tolte:</i><br />
<i>Che non conversiam' sempre con gli amici,</i><br />
<i>In questa assai più oscura che serena</i><br />
<i>Vita mortal, tutta d'invidia piena</i><a name="FNanchor_10_93" id="FNanchor_10_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_93" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;"><i>&mdash;Orl. Fur.</i>, IV., 1.</span><br />
</p>

<p>I may, then, without any injustice match cunning with cunning, and
anticipate all crafty encroachments on me, even if they be only
probable; and I need neither render an account to him who unwarrantably
pries into my personal circumstances, nor by replying: "I cannot
answer this," show him the spot where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> have a secret, which perilous
to me, and perhaps advantageous to him, in any case puts me in his
power, if divulged: <i>Scire volunt secreta domus, atque inde timeri</i>.
(They wish to know family secrets, and thus become feared.) On the
contrary, I am justified in putting him off with a lie, involving
danger to himself, in case he is thereby led into a mistake that
works him harm. Indeed, a falsehood is the only means of opposing
inquisitive and suspicious curiosity; to meet which it is the one
weapon of necessary self-defence. "Ask me no questions, and I'll tell
you no lies" is here the right maxim. For among the English, who regard
the reproach of being a liar as the deepest insult, and who on that
account are really more truthful than other nations, all unjustifiable
questions, having to do with another's affairs, are looked upon as
a piece of ill-breeding, which is denoted by the expression, "to
ask questions." Certainly every sensible person, even when he is
of the strictest rectitude, follows the principle above set forth.
Suppose, for instance, such a one is returning from a remote spot,
where he has raised a sum of money; and suppose an unknown traveller
joins him, and after the customary "whither" and "whence" gradually
proceeds to inquire what may have taken him to that place; the former
will undoubtedly give a false answer in order to avoid the danger
of robbery. Again: if a man be found in the house of another, whose
daughter he is wooing; and he is asked the cause of his unexpected
presence; unless he has entirely lost his head, he will not give the
true reason, but unhesitatingly invent a pretext. And the cases are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
numberless in which every reasonable being tells an untruth, without
the least scruple of conscience. It is this view of the matter alone
that removes the crying contradiction between the morality which is
taught, and that which is daily practised, even by the best and most
upright of men. At the same time, the restriction of a falsehood to
the single purpose of self-defence must be rigidly observed; for
otherwise this doctrine would admit of terrible abuse, a lie being in
itself a very dangerous instrument. But just as, even in time of public
peace, the law allows every one to carry weapons and to use them, when
required for self-defence, so Ethics permits lies to be employed for
the same purpose, and&mdash;be it observed&mdash;for this one purpose only. Every
mendacious word is a wrong, excepting only when the occasion arises of
defending oneself against violence or cunning. Hence justice requires
truthfulness towards all men. But the entirely unconditional and
unreserved condemnation of lies, as properly involved in their nature,
is sufficiently refuted by well known facts. Thus, there are cases
where a falsehood is a <b>duty</b>, especially for doctors; and there
are <b>magnanimous</b> lies, as, for instance, that of the Marquis
Posa in <i>Don Carlos</i><a name="FNanchor_11_94" id="FNanchor_11_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_94" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> or that in the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>, II.,
22;<a name="FNanchor_12_95" id="FNanchor_12_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_95" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> they occur, indeed, whenever a man wills to take on himself
the guilt of another; and lastly, Jesus Christ himself is reported
(<i>John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></i> vii. 8; cf. ver. 10) on one occasion to have intentionally
told an untruth. The reader will remember that Campanella, in his
<i>Poesie Filosofiche</i> (Delia Bellezza: Madr. 9), does not hesitate to
say: "<i>Bello è il mentir, se a fare gran ben' si trova</i>."<a name="FNanchor_13_96" id="FNanchor_13_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_96" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> On the
other hand, the current teaching as regards necessary falsehoods is a
wretched patch on the dress of a poverty-stricken morality. Kant is
responsible for the theory found in many text-books, which derives
the unjustifiableness of lies from man's faculty of speech; but the
arguments are so tame, childish and absurd that one might well be
tempted, if only to pour contempt on them, to join sides with the
devil, and say with Talleyrand: <i>l'homme a reçu la parole pour pouvoir
cacher sa pensée</i><a name="FNanchor_14_97" id="FNanchor_14_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_97" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. The unqualified and boundless horror shown by
Kant for falsehoods, whenever he has the opportunity, is due either to
affectation, or to prejudice. In the chapter of his "<i>Tugendlehre</i>,"
dealing with lies, he loads them with every kind of defamatory epithet,
but does not adduce a single adequate reason for their condemnation;
which would have been more to the point. Declamation is easier than
demonstration, and to moralise less difficult than to be sincere. Kant
would have done better to open the vials of his wrath on that vice
which takes pleasure in seeing others suffer; it is the latter, and not
a falsehood, which is truly fiendish. For malignant joy is the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
opposite of Compassion, and nothing else but powerless cruelty, which,
unable itself to bring about the misery it so gladly beholds others
enduring, is thankful to <i>Τύχη</i> for having done so instead. According
to the code of knightly honour, the reproach of being a liar is of
extreme gravity, and only to be washed out with the accuser's blood.
Now this obtains, not because the lie is wrong in itself, since, were
such the reason, to accuse a man of an injury done by violence would
certainly be regarded as equally outrageous,&mdash;which is not the case,
as every one knows; but it is due to that principle of chivalry, which
in reality bases right on might; so that whoever, when trying to work
mischief, has recourse to falsehood, proves that he lacks either power,
or the requisite courage. Every untruth bears witness of his fear; and
this is why a fatal verdict is passed on him.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_VIIc" id="CHAPTER_VIIc">CHAPTER VII.</a></h4>

<h3>THE VIRTUE OF LOVING-KINDNESS.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>Thus justice is the primary and essentially cardinal virtue. Ancient
philosophers recognised it as such, but made it co-ordinate with three
others unsuitably chosen.<a name="FNanchor_1_98" id="FNanchor_1_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_98" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Loving-kindness (<i>caritas, ἀγάπη</i>) was not
as yet ranked as a virtue. Plato himself, who rises highest in moral
science, reaches only so far as voluntary, disinterested justice. It
is true that loving-kindness has existed at all times in practice and
in fact; but it was reserved for Christianity,&mdash;whose greatest service
is seen in this&mdash;to theoretically formulate, and expressly advance it
not only as a virtue, but as the queen of all; and to extend it even
to enemies. We are thinking of course only of Europe. For in Asia, a
thousand years before, the boundless love of one's neighbour had been
prescribed and taught, as well as practised: the <span class="gesperrt">Vedas</span><a name="FNanchor_2_99" id="FNanchor_2_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_99" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> full
of it; while in the <span class="gesperrt">Dharma-Śāstra</span>,<a name="FNanchor_3_100" id="FNanchor_3_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_100" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <span class="gesperrt">Itihāsa</span>,<a name="FNanchor_4_101" id="FNanchor_4_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_101" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and <span class="gesperrt">Purāna</span><a name="FNanchor_5_102" id="FNanchor_5_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_102" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> it
constantly recurs, to say nothing of the preaching of <span class="gesperrt">Śakya-muni</span>, the
Buddha. And to be quite accurate we must admit that there are traces
to be found among the Greeks and Romans of a recommendation to follow
loving-kindness; for instance, in Cicero, <i>De Finibus</i>, V., 23;<a name="FNanchor_6_103" id="FNanchor_6_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_103" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
also in Pythagoras, according to Iamblichus, <i>De vita Pythagorae</i>,
chap. 33.<a name="FNanchor_7_104" id="FNanchor_7_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_104" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> My task is now to give a philosophical derivation of this
virtue from the principle I have laid down.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated in Chapter V. of this Part, that the sense of
Compassion, however much its origin is shrouded in mystery, is the one
and sole cause whereby the suffering I see in another, of itself, and
as such, becomes directly my motive; and we have seen that the first
stage of this process is <b>negative</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> The second degree is sharply
distinguished from the first, through the <b>positive</b> character
of the actions resulting therefrom; for at this point Compassion
does more than keep me back from injuring my neighbour; it impels me
to help him. And according as, on the one hand, my sense of direct
participation is keen and deep, and, on the other hand, the distress
is great and urgent, so shall I be constrained by this motive, which
(be it noted) is purely and wholly moral, to make a greater or less
sacrifice in order to meet the need or the calamity which I observe;
and this sacrifice may involve the expenditure of my bodily or mental
powers, the loss of my property, freedom, or even life. So that in
this direct <b>suffering with</b> another, which rests on no arguments
and requires none, is found the one simple origin of loving-kindness,
<i>caritas, aγάπη</i> in other words, that virtue whose rule is: <i>Omnes,
quantum potes, juva</i> (help all people, as far as lies in your power);
and from which all those actions proceed which are prescribed by
Ethics under the name of duties of virtue, otherwise called duties of
love, or imperfect duties. It is solely by direct and, as it were,
instinctive participation in the sufferings which we see, in other
words, by Compassion, that conduct so defined is occasioned; at least
when it can be said to have moral worth, that is, be declared free
from all egoistic motives, and when on that account it awakens in us
that inward contentment which is called a good, satisfied, approving
conscience, and elicits from the spectator (not without making him
cast a humiliating glance at himself), that remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> commendation,
respect, and admiration which are too well-known to be denied.</p>

<p>But if a beneficent action have any other motive whatever, then it
must be egoistic, if not actually malicious. For as the fundamental
springs of all human conduct (<i>v</i>. Chapter V. of this Part), are three,
namely, Egoism, Malice, Compassion; so the various motives which are
capable of affecting men may be grouped under three general heads: (1)
one's own weal; (2) others' woe; (3) others' weal. Now if the motive
of a kind act does not belong to the third class, it must of course
be found in the first or second. To the second it is occasionally to
be ascribed; for instance, if I do good to some one, in order to vex
another, to whom I am hostile; or to make the latter's sufferings more
acute; or, it may be, to put to shame a third person, who refrained
from helping; or lastly, to inflict a mortification on the man whom I
benefit. But it much more usually springs from the first class. And
this is the case whenever, in doing some good, I have in view my own
weal, no matter how remote or indirect it may be; that is, whenever
I am influenced by the thought of reward whether in this, or in
another, world, or by the hope of winning high esteem, and of gaining
a reputation for nobleness of character; or again, when I reflect that
the person, whom I now aid, may one day be able to assist me in return,
or otherwise be of some service and benefit; or when, lastly, I am
guided by the consideration that I must keep the rules of magnanimity
and beneficence, because I too may on some occasion profit thereby. In
a word, my motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> is egoistic as soon as it is anything other than
the purely objective desire of simply knowing, without any ulterior
purpose, that my neighbour is helped, delivered from his distress and
need, or freed from his suffering. If such an aim&mdash;shorn, as it is, of
all subjectivity&mdash;be really mine, then, and then only, have I given
proof of that loving-kindness, <i>caritas, ἀγάπη</i>, which it is the great
and distinguishing merit of Christianity to have preached. It should
be observed, in this connection, that the injunctions which the Gospel
adds to its commandment of love, <i>e.g., μὴ γνώτω ἡ ἀρίστερα σου, τί
ποιεῑ ἡ δεξιά σου</i> (let not thy left hand know what thy right hand
doeth), and the like, are, in point of fact, based on a consciousness
of the conclusion I have here reached,&mdash;namely, that another's
distress, of itself alone, without any further consideration, must be
my motive, if what I do is to be of moral value. And in the same place
(<i>Matth</i>. vi. 2) we find it stated with perfect truth that ostentations
almsgivers <i>ἀπέχουσιν τὸν μισθὸν αὐτῶν</i>. (Get in full&mdash;exhaust their
reward.) Although, in this respect too, the Vedas shed on us the light
of a higher teaching. They repeatedly declare that he, who desires any
sort of recompense for his work, is still wandering in the path of
darkness, and not yet ripe for deliverance. If any one should ask me
what he gets from a charitable act, my answer in all sincerity would
be: "This, that the lot of the poor man you relieve is just so much the
lighter; otherwise absolutely nothing. If you are not satisfied, and
feel that such is not a sufficient end, then your wish was not to give
alms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> but to make a purchase; and you have effected a bad bargain.
But if the one thing you are concerned with is that he should feel the
pressure of poverty less; then you have gained your object; you have
diminished his suffering, and you see exactly how far your gift is
requited."</p>

<p>Now, how is it possible that trouble which is not mine, and by which
I am untouched, should become as direct a motive to me as if it were
my own, and incite me to action? As already explained, only through
the fact that, although it comes before me merely as something outside
myself, by means of the external medium of sight or hearing; I am,
nevertheless, sensible of it with the sufferer; I feel it as my own,
not indeed in myself, but in him And so what Calderon said comes to
pass:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%;">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><i>que entre el ver</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;"><i>Padecer y el padecer</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;"><i>Ninguna distancia habia</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>No Siempre lo Peor es Cierto</i>. Jorn. II., Esc. 9.)<a name="FNanchor_8_105" id="FNanchor_8_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_105" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>This, however, presupposes that to a certain extent I have become
identified with the other, and consequently that the barrier between
the ego and the non-ego is, for the moment, broken down. It is then,
and then only, that I make his interests, his need, his distress, his
suffering directly my own; it is then that the empirical picture I have
of him vanishes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> and I no longer see the stranger, who is entirely
unlike myself, and to whom I am indifferent; but I share his pain in
him, despite the certainty that his skin does not enclose my nerves.
Only in this way is it possible for <b>his</b> woe, <b>his</b> distress
to become a motive <b>for me</b>; otherwise I should be influenced
solely by my own. This process is, I repeat, <b>mysterious</b>. For it
is one which Reason can give no direct account of, and its causes lie
outside the field of experience. And yet it is of daily occurrence.
Every one has often felt its working within himself; even to the most
hard-hearted and selfish it is not unknown. Each day that passes brings
it before our eyes, in single acts, on a small scale; whenever a man,
by direct impulse, without much reflection, helps a fellow-creature and
comes to his aid, sometimes even exposing himself to the most imminent
peril for the sake of one he has never seen before, and this, without
once thinking of anything but the fact that he witnesses another's
great distress and danger. It was manifested on a large scale, when
after long consideration, and many a stormy debate, the noble-hearted
British nation gave twenty millions of pounds to ransom the negroes in
its colonies, with the approbation and joy of a whole world. If any one
refuses to recognise in Compassion the cause of this deed, magnificent
as it is in its grand proportions, and prefers to ascribe it to
Christianity; let him remember that in the whole of the New Testament
not one word is said against slavery, though at that time it was
practically universal; and further, that as late as A.D. 1860, in North
America, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> question was being discussed, a man was found who
thought to strengthen his case by appealing to the fact that Abraham
and Jacob kept slaves!</p>

<p>What will be in each separate case the practical effect of this
mysterious inner process may be left to Ethics to analyse, in chapters
and paragraphs entitled "Duties of Virtue," "Duties of Love,"
"Imperfect Duties," or whatever other name be used. The root, the
basis of all these is the one here indicated; for out of it arises
the primary precept: <i>Omnes, quantum potes, juva</i>; from which in turn
everything else required can very easily be deduced; just as out of the
<i>Neminem laede</i>&mdash;the first half of my principle&mdash;all duties of justice
are derivable. Ethics is in truth the easiest of all sciences. And
this is only to be expected, since it is incumbent on each person to
construct it for himself, and himself form the rule for every case, as
it occurs, out of the fundamental law which lies deep in his heart; for
few have leisure and patience enough to learn a ready-made system of
Morals. From justice and loving-kindness spring all the other virtues;
for which reason these two may properly be called cardinal, and the
disclosure of their origin lays the corner-stone of Moral Science. The
entire ethical content of the Old Testament is justice; loving-kindness
being that of the New. The latter is the <i>καινὴ ἐντολὴ</i> (the new
commandment [<i>John</i> xiii. 34]), which according to Paul (<i>Romans</i> xiii.
8-10) includes all Christian virtues.</p>

<h4><a id="CHAPTER_VIIIc"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<h3>THE PROOF NOW GIVEN CONFIRMED BY EXPERIENCE.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />
<p>
The truth I have here laid down, that Compassion
is the sole non-egoistic stimulus, and therefore the
only really moral one, is a strange, indeed almost
incomprehensible paradox. I shall hope, therefore,
to render it less extraordinary to the reader, if I
show that it is confirmed by experience, and by the
universal testimony of human sentiment.</p>
<p>
(1) For this purpose I shall, in the first place,
state an imaginary case, which in the present investigation
may serve as an <i>experimentum crucis</i><a name="FNanchor_1_106" id="FNanchor_1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_106" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (a crucial
test). But not to make the matter too easy, I shall
take no instance of loving-kindness, but rather a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>breach of lawful right, and that of the worse kind.
Let us suppose two young people, Caius and Titus,
to be passionately in love, each with a different girl,
and that both are completely thwarted by two other
men who are preferred because of certain external
circumstances. They have both resolved to put their
rivals out of the way, and are perfectly secure from
every chance of detection, even from all suspicion.
But when they come to actually prepare for the
murder, each of them, after an inward struggle,
draws back. They are now to give us a truthful and
clear account of the reasons why they abandoned
their project. As for Caius, I leave it entirely to
the reader to choose what motive he likes. It may
be that religions grounds checked him; for instance,
the thought of the Divine Will, of future
retribution, of the judgment to come, etc. Or perhaps
he may say: "I reflected that the principle I was
going to apply in this case would not be adapted to
provide a rule universally valid for all possible
rational beings; because I should have treated my
rival only as a means, and not at the same time as
an end." Or, following Fichte, he may deliver
himself as follows: "Every human life is a means
towards realising the moral law; consequently, I
cannot, without being indifferent to this realisation,
destroy a being ordained to do his part in effecting
it."&mdash;(<i>Sittenlehre</i>, p. 373.) (This scruple, be it observed
in passing, he might well overcome by the
hope of soon producing a new instrument of the moral
law, when once in possession of his beloved.) Or,
again, he may speak after the fashion of Wollaston:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>"I considered that such an action would be the
expression of a false tenet." Or like Hutcheson: "The
Moral Sense, whose perceptions, equally with those
of every other sense, admit of no final explanation,
forbade me to commit such a deed." Or like Adam
Smith: "I foresaw that my act would awaken no
sympathy with me in the minds of the spectators."
Or his language may be borrowed from Christian
Wolff: "I recognised that I should thereby advance
neither the work of making myself perfect, nor the
same process in any one else." Or from Spinoza:
"<i>Homini nihil utilius homine: ergo hominem interimere
nolui</i>." (To man nothing is more useful than man:
therefore I was unwilling to destroy a man.) In
short, he may say what one pleases. But Titus,
whose explanation is supplied by myself, will speak
as follows: "When I came to make arrangements
for the work, and so, for the moment, had to occupy
myself not with my own passion, but with my rival;
then for the first time I saw clearly what was going
to happen to him. But simultaneously I was seized
with compassion and pity; sorrow for him laid hold
upon me, and overmastered me: I could not strike the
blow." Now I ask every honest and unprejudiced
reader: Which of these two is the better man? To
which would he prefer to entrust his own destiny?
Which is restrained by the purer motive? Consequently,
where does the basis of morality lie?</p>
<p>
(2) There is nothing that revolts our moral sense
so much as cruelty. Every other offence we can
pardon, but not cruelty. The reason is found in the
fact that cruelty is the exact opposite of Compassion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>When we hear of intensely cruel conduct, as, for
instance, the act, which has just been recorded in
the papers, of a mother, who murdered her little
son of five years, by pouring boiling oil into his
throat, and her younger child, by burying it alive;
or what was recently reported from Algiers: how a
casual dispute between a Spaniard and an Algerine
ended in a fight; and how the latter, having vanquished
the other, tore out the whole of his lower
jaw bone, and carried it off as a trophy, leaving his
adversary still alive;&mdash;when we hear of cruelty like
this, we are seized with horror, and exclaim: "How
is it possible to do such a thing?" Now, let me
ask what this question signifies. Does it mean:
"How is it possible to fear so little the punishments
of the future life?" It is difficult to admit this
interpretation. Then perhaps it intends to say:
"How is it possible to act according to a principle
which is so absolutely unfitted to become a general
law for all rational beings?" Certainly not. Or,
once more: "How is it possible to neglect so utterly
one's own perfection as well as that of another?"'
This is equally unimaginable. The sense of the
question is assuredly nothing but this: "How is
it possible to be so utterly bereft of compassion?"
The conclusion is that when an action is characterised
by an extraordinary absence of compassion, it bears
the certain stamp of the deepest depravity and loathsomeness.
Hence Compassion is the true moral
incentive.</p>
<p>
(3) The ethical basis, or the original moral stimulus,
which I have disclosed, is the only one that can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>justly said to have a real and extended sphere of
effective influence. No one will surely venture to
maintain as much of all the other moral principles
that philosophers have set up; for these are composed
of abstract, sometimes even of hair-splitting propositions,
with no foundation other than an artificial
combination of ideas; such that their application
to actual conduct would often incline to the comic.
A good action, inspired solely by Kant's Moral Principle,
would be at bottom the work of philosophic
pedantry; or else would lead the doer into self-deception,
through his reason interpreting conduct,
which had other, perhaps nobler, incentives, as the
product of the Categorical Imperative, and of the
conception of Duty, which, as we have seen, rests
on nothing. But not only is it true that the <b>philosophic</b>
moral principles, purely theoretical as they
are, have seldom any operative power; of those
established by <b>religion</b>, and expressly framed for
practical purposes, it is equally difficult to predicate
any marked efficiency. The chief evidence of this lies
in the fact that in spite of the great religious differences
in the world, the amount of morality, or rather
of immorality, shows no corresponding variation, but
in essentials is pretty much the same everywhere.
Only it is important not to confound rudeness and
refinement with morality and immorality. The religion
of Hellas had an exceedingly small moral
tendency,&mdash;it hardly went further than respect for
oaths. No dogma was taught, and no system of
Ethics publicly preached; nevertheless, all things
considered, it does not appear that the Greeks were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>morally inferior to the men of the Christian era. The
morality of Christianity is of a much higher kind than
that of any other religion which previously appeared
in Europe. But if any one should believe for this
reason that European morals have improved proportionally,
and that now at any rate they surpass
what obtains elsewhere, it would not be difficult to
demonstrate that among the Mohammedans, Gnebres,
Hindus, and Buddhists, there is at least as much
honesty, fidelity, toleration, gentleness, beneficence,
nobleness, and self-denial as among Christian peoples.
Indeed, the scale will be found rather to turn unfavourably
for Christendom, when we put into the balance
the long list of inhuman cruelties which have constantly
been perpetrated within its limits and often
in its name. We need only recall for a moment the
numerous religious wars; the crusades that nothing
can justify; the extirpation of a large part of the
American aborigines, and the peopling of that continent
by negroes, brought over from Africa, without
the shadow of a right, torn from their families, their
country, their hemisphere, and, as slaves, condemned
for life to forced labour;<a name="FNanchor_2_107" id="FNanchor_2_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_107" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the tireless persecution of
heretics; the unspeakable atrocities of the Inquisition,
that cried aloud to heaven; the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew; the execution of 18,000 persons in
the Netherlands by the Duke of Alva; and these are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>but a few facts among many. Speaking generally,
however, if we compare with the performances of its
followers the excellent morality which Christianity,
and, more or less, every creed preaches, and then
try to imagine how far theory would become practice,
if crime were not impeded by the secular arm of the
state; nay more, what would probably happen, if, for
only one day all laws should be suspended; we shall
be obliged to confess that the effect of the various
religions on Morals is in fact very small. This is
of course due to weakness of faith. Theoretically,
and so long as it is only a question of piety in the
abstract, every one supposes his belief to be firm
enough. Only the searching touch-stone of all our
convictions is&mdash;what we do. When the moment for
acting arrives, and our faith has to be tested by
great self-denial and heavy sacrifices, then its feebleness
becomes evident. If a man is seriously planning
some evil, he has already broken the bounds of true
and pure morality. Thenceforward the chief restraint
that checks him is invariably the dread of justice
and the police. Should he be so hopeful of escaping
detection as to cast such fears aside, the next
barrier that meets him is regard for his honour. If
this second rampart be crossed, there is very little
likelihood, after both these powerful hindrances are
withdrawn, that any religious dogma will appeal
to him strongly enough to keep him back from the
deed. For if he be not frightened by near and
immediate dangers, he will hardly be curbed by
terrors which are distant, and rest merely on belief.
Moreover, there is a positive objection that may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>brought against all good conduct proceeding solely from
religions conviction; it is not purged of self-interest,
but done out of regard for reward and punishment, and
hence can have no purely moral value. This view we
find very clearly expressed in a letter of the celebrated
Grand-Duke of Weimar, Karl August. He writes:
"Baron Weyhers was himself of opinion that he, who
is good through religion, and not by natural inclination,
must be a bad fellow at heart. <i>In vino veritas.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_3_108" id="FNanchor_3_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_108" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
&mdash;(<i>Letters to J. H. Merck</i>; No. 229.) But now let us
turn to the moral incentive which I have disclosed.
Who ventures for a moment to deny that it displays
a marked and truly wonderful influence at all times,
among all peoples, in all circumstances of life; even
when constitutional law is suspended, and the horrors
of revolutions and wars fill the air; in small things
and in great, every day and every hour? Who will
refuse to admit that it is constantly preventing much
wrong, and calling into existence many a good action,
often quite unexpectedly, and where there is no hope
of reward? Is there any one who will gainsay the
fact that, where it and it alone has been operative,
we all with deep respect and emotion unreservedly
recognise the presence of genuine moral worth?</p>
<p>
(4) Boundless compassion for all living beings
is the surest and most certain guarantee of pure moral
conduct, and needs no casuistry. Whoever is filled
with it will assuredly injure no one, do harm to no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>one, encroach on no man's rights; he will rather have
regard for every one, forgive every one, help every
one as far as he can, and all his actions will bear the
stamp of justice and loving-kindness. On the other
hand, if we try to say: "This man is virtuous, but
he is a stranger to Compassion"; or: "he is an
unjust and malicious man, yet very compassionate;"
the contradiction at once leaps to light. In former
times the English plays used to finish with a petition
for the King. The old Indian dramas close with
these words: "May all living beings be delivered
from pain." Tastes differ; but in my opinion there
is no more beautiful prayer than this.</p>
<p>
(5) Also from separate matters of detail it may
be inferred that the original stimulus of true morality
is Compassion. For instance, to make a man lose
a hundred thalers, by legal tricks involving no
danger, is equally unjust, whether he be rich or poor;
but in the latter case the rapping of conscience is
much louder, the censure of disinterested witnesses
more emphatic. Aristotle was well aware of this,
and said: <i>δεινότερον δέ εστι τὸν ἀτυχοῡντα, ἢ τον
ετὐχοῡντα, ἀδικεῑν</i>. (It is worse to injure a man
in adversity than one who is prosperous.)&mdash;(<i>Probl.</i>
xxix. 2.) If the man have wealth, self-reproach is
proportionally faint, and grows still fainter, if it be
the treasury that has been overreached; for state
coffers can form no object of Compassion. It thus
appears that the grounds for self-accusation as well
as for the spectators' blame are not furnished directly
by the infringement of the law, but chiefly by the
suffering thereby brought upon others. The violation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>of right, by itself and as such, which is involved in
cheating the exchequer, (to take the above instance,)
will be disapproved by the conscience alike of actor
and witness; but only because, and in so far as, the
rule of respecting <b>every</b> right, which forms the <i>sine
qua non</i> of all honourable conduct, is in consequence
broken. The stricture passed will, in fact, be indirect
and limited. If, however, it be a confidential
<i>employé</i> in the service that commits the fraud, the
case assumes quite another aspect; it then has all
the specific attributes of, and belongs to, that class
of actions described above, whose characteristic is
a <b>double injustice</b>. The analysis here given explains
why the worst charge which can ever be brought
against rapacious extortioners and legal sharpers is,
that they appropriate for themselves the goods of
widows and orphans. The reason appears in the
fact that the latter, more than others, owing to their
helplessness, might be expected to excite Compassion
in the most callous heart. Hence we conclude that
the entire absence of this sense is sufficient to lower
a man to the last degree of villainy.</p>
<p>
(6) Compassion is the root no less of justice than
of loving-kindness; but it is more clearly evidenced
in the latter than in the former. We never receive
proofs of genuine loving-kindness on the part of others,
so long as we are in all respects prosperous. The
happy man may, no doubt, often hear the words of
good-will on his relations' and friends' lips; but
the expression of that pure, disinterested, objective
participation in the condition and lot of others, which
loving-kindness begets, is reserved for him who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>stricken with some sorrow or suffering, whatever
it be. For the fortunate <b>as such</b> we do not feel
sympathy; unless they have some other claim on
us, they remain alien to our hearts: <i>habeant sibi sua.</i>
(They may keep their own affairs, pleasures, etc., to
themselves.) Nay, if a man has many advantages
over others, he will easily become an object of envy,
which is ready, should he once fall from his height
of prosperity, to turn into malignant joy. Nevertheless
this menace is, for the most part, not fulfilled;
the Sophoclean <i>γελῶσι δ' ἐχθροί </i> (his enemies laugh)
does not generally become an actual fact. As soon
as the day of ruin comes to one of fortune's spoiled
children, there usually takes place a great transformation
in the minds of his acquaintances, which for us
in this connection is very instructive. In the first
place this change clearly reveals the real nature of
the interest that the friends of his happiness took
in him: <i>diffugiunt cadis cum faece siccatis amici.</i>
(When the casks are drained to the dregs, one's
friends run away.)<a name="FNanchor_4_109" id="FNanchor_4_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_109" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On the other hand, the exultation
of those who envied his prosperity, the mocking laugh
of malicious satisfaction, which he feared more than
adversity itself, and the contemplation of which he
could not face, are things usually spared him. Jealousy
is appeased, and disappears with its cause; while
Compassion which takes its place is the parent of
loving-kindness. Those who were envious of, and
hostile to, a man in the full tide of success, after his
downfall, have not seldom become his friends, ready
to protect, comfort, and help. Who has not, at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>in a small way, himself experienced something of the
sort? Where is the man, who, when overtaken by
some calamity, of whatever nature, has not noticed
with surprise how the persons that previously had
displayed the greatest coldness, nay, ill-will towards
him, then came forward with unfeigned sympathy?
For misfortune is the condition of Compassion, and
Compassion the source of loving-kindness. When our
wrath is kindled against a person, nothing quenches
it so quickly, even when it is righteous, as the words:
"He is an unfortunate man." And the reason is
obvious: Compassion is to anger as water to fire.
Therefore, whoever would fain have nothing to repent
of, let him listen to my advice. When he is inflamed
with rage, and meditates doing some one a grievous
injury, he should bring the thing vividly before his
mind, as a <i>fait accompli</i>; he should clearly picture
to himself this other fellow-being tormented with
mental or bodily pain, or struggling with need and
misery; so that he is forced to exclaim: "This is
my work!" Such thoughts as these, if anything,
will avail to moderate his wrath. For Compassion
is the true antidote of anger; and by practising on
oneself this artifice of the imagination, one awakes
beforehand, while there is yet time,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;"><i>la pitié, dont la voix,</i></span><br />
<i>Alors qu'on est vengé, fait entendre ses lois</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_110" id="FNanchor_5_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_110" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">&mdash;(Voltaire, <i>Sémiramis</i>, V. 6.)</span><br />
</p>

<p>And in general, the hatred we may cherish for others is overcome by
nothing so easily as by our taking a point of view whence they can
appeal to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> Compassion. The reason indeed why parents, as a rule,
specially love the sickly one of their children is because the sight of
it perpetually stirs their Compassion.</p>

<p>(7) There is another proof that the moral incentive disclosed by me
is the true one. I mean the fact that animals also are included under
its protecting aegis. In the other European systems of Ethics no place
is found for them,&mdash;strange and inexcusable as this may appear. It is
asserted that beasts have no rights; the illusion is harboured that our
conduct, so far as they are concerned, has no moral significance, or,
as it is put in the language of these codes, that "there are no duties
to be fulfilled towards animals." Such a view is one of revolting
coarseness, a barbarism of the West, whose source is Judaism. In
philosophy, however, it rests on the assumption, despite all evidence
to the contrary, of the radical difference between man and beast,&mdash;a
doctrine which, as is well known, was proclaimed with more trenchant
emphasis by Descartes than by any one else: it was indeed the necessary
consequence of his mistakes. When Leibnitz and Wolff, following out
the Cartesian view, built up out of abstract ideas their Rational
Psychology, and constructed a deathless <i>anima rationalis</i> (rational
soul); then the natural claims of the animal kingdom visibly rose up
against this exclusive privilege, this human patent of immortality, and
Nature, as always in such circumstances, entered her silent protest.
Our philosophers, owing to the qualms of their intellectual conscience,
were soon forced to seek aid for their Rational Psychology from the
empirical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> method; they accordingly tried to reveal the existence of
a vast chasm, an immeasurable gulf between animals and men, in order
to represent them, in the teeth of opposing testimony, as existences
essentially different. These efforts did not escape the ridicule of
Boileau; for we find him saying:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<i>Les animaux ont-ils des universités?</i><br />
<i>Voit-on fleurir chez eux des quatre facultés?</i><a name="FNanchor_6_111" id="FNanchor_6_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_111" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Such a supposition would end in animals being pronounced incapable
of distinguishing themselves from the external world, and of having
any self-consciousness, any ego! As answer to such absurd tenets, it
would only be necessary to point to the boundless Egoism innate in
every animal, even the smallest and humblest; this amply proves how
perfectly they are conscious of their self, as opposed to the world,
which lies outside it. If any one of the Cartesian persuasion, with
views like these in his head, should find himself in the claws of a
tiger, he would be taught in the most forcible manner what a sharp
distinction such a beast draws between his ego and the non-ego.
Corresponding to these philosophical fallacies we notice a peculiar
sophism in the speech of many peoples, especially the Germans. For the
commonest matters connected with the processes of life,&mdash;for food,
drink, conception, the bringing forth of young; for death, and the dead
body; such languages have special words applicable only to animals,
not to men. In this way the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> necessity of using the same terms for
both is avoided, and the perfect identity of the thing concealed under
verbal differences. Now, since the ancient tongues show no trace of
such a dual mode of expression, but frankly denote the same things
by the same words; it follows that this miserable artifice is beyond
all doubt the work of European priestcraft, which, in its profanity,
knows no limit to its disavowal of, and blasphemy against, the Eternal
Reality that lives in every animal. Thus was laid the foundation of
that harshness and cruelty towards beasts which is customary in Europe,
and on which a native of the Asiatic uplands could not look without
righteous horror. In English this infamous invention is not to be
found; assuredly because the Saxons, when they conquered England, were
not yet Christians. Nevertheless the English language shows something
analogous in the strange fact that it makes all animals of the neuter
gender, the pronoun "it" being employed for them, just as if they
were lifeless things. This idiom has a very objectionable sound,
especially in the case of dogs, monkeys, and other Primates, and is
unmistakably a priestly trick, designed to reduce beasts to the level
of inanimate objects. The ancient Egyptians, who dedicated all their
days to religion, were accustomed to place in the same vault with a
human mummy that of an ibis, a crocodile, etc.; in Europe it is a
crime, an abomination to bury a faithful dog beside the resting-place
of his master, though it is there perhaps that he, with a fidelity
and attachment unknown to the sons of men, awaited his own end. To a
recognition of the identity, in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> essentials, of the phaenomena
which we call "man" and "beast," nothing leads more surely than the
study of zoology and anatomy. What shall we say then, when in these
days (1839) a canting dissector has been found, who presumes to insist
on an absolute and radical difference between human beings and animals,
and who goes so far as to attack and calumniate honest zoologists that
keep aloof from all priestly guile, eye-service, and hypocrisy, and
dare to follow the leading of nature and of truth?</p>

<p>Those persons must indeed be totally blind, or else completely
chloroformed by the <i>foetor Judaicus</i> (Jewish stench), who do not
discern that the truly essential and fundamental part in man and beast
is identically the same thing. That which distinguishes the one from
the other does not lie in the primary and original principle, in the
inner nature, in the kernel of the two phaenomena (this kernel being
in both alike the Will of the individual); it is found in what is
secondary, in the intellect, in the degree of perceptive capacity. It
is true that the latter is incomparably higher in man, by reason of
his added faculty of abstract knowledge, called Reason; nevertheless
this superiority is traceable solely to a greater cerebral development,
in other words, to the corporeal difference, which is quantitative,
not qualitative, of a single part, the brain. In all other respects
the similarity between men and animals, both psychical and bodily, is
sufficiently striking. So that we must remind our judaised friends
in the West, who despise animals, and idolise Reason, that if they
were suckled by their mothers, so also was the dog by his. Even Kant
fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> into this common mistake of his age, and of his country, and I
have already administered the censure<a name="FNanchor_7_112" id="FNanchor_7_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_112" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> which it is impossible to
withhold. The fact that Christian morality takes no thought for beasts
is a defect in the system which is better admitted than perpetuated.
One's astonishment is, however, all the greater, because, with this
exception, it shows the closest agreement with the Ethics of Brahmanism
and Buddhism, being only less strongly expressed, and not carried to
the last consequences imposed by logic. On the whole, there seems
little room for doubting that, in common with the idea of a god become
man, or Avatar,<a name="FNanchor_8_113" id="FNanchor_8_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_113" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> it has an Asiatic origin, and probably came to
Judaea by way of Egypt; so that Christianity would be a secondary
reflection of the primordial light that shone in India, which,
falling first on Egypt, was unhappily refracted from its ruins upon
Jewish soil. An apt symbol of the insensibility of Christian Ethics
to animals, while in other points its similarity to the Indian is so
great, may be found in the circumstance that John the Baptist comes
before us in all respects like a Hindu Sannyasin,<a name="FNanchor_9_114" id="FNanchor_9_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_114" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> except that he
is clothed in skins: a thing which would be, as is well known, an
abomination in the eyes of every follower of Brahmanism or Buddhism.
The Royal Society of Calcutta only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> received their copy of the <span class="gesperrt">Vedas</span>
on their distinctly promising that they would not have it bound in
leather, after European fashion. In silken binding, therefore, it is
now to be seen on the shelves of their library. Again: the Gospel story
of Peter's draught of fishes, which the Saviour blesses so signally
that the boats are overladen, and begin to sink (<i>Luke</i> v. 1-10),
forms a characteristic contrast to what is related of Pythagoras. It
is said that the latter, initiated as he was in all the wisdom of the
Egyptians, bought the draught from the fishermen, while the net was
still under water, in order to at once set at liberty the captive
denizens of the sea. (Apuleius: <i>De Magia</i>, p. 36: edit. Bipont.)<a name="FNanchor_10_115" id="FNanchor_10_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_115" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Compassion for animals is intimately connected with goodness of
character, and it may be confidently asserted that he, who is cruel
to living creatures, cannot be a good man. Moreover, this compassion
manifestly flows from the same source whence arise the virtues of
justice and loving-kindness towards men. Thus, for instance, people
of delicate sensitiveness, on realising that in a fit of ill-humour,
or anger, or under the influence of wine, they punished their dog,
their horse, their ape undeservedly, or unnecessarily, or excessively,
are seized with the same remorse, feel the same dissatisfaction with
themselves, as when they are conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> of having done some wrong to
one of their fellows. The only difference&mdash;a purely nominal one&mdash;is
that in the latter case this remorse, this dissatisfaction is called
the voice of conscience rising in rebuke. I remember having read of
an Englishman, who, when hunting in India, had killed a monkey, that
he could not forget the dying look which the creature cast on him; so
that he never fired at these animals again. Another sportsman, William
Harris by name, a true Nimrod, has much the same story to tell. During
the years 1836-7 he travelled far into the heart of Africa, merely to
indulge his passion for the chase. A passage in his book, published at
Bombay in 1838, describes how he shot his first elephant, a female.
Next morning on going to look for his game, he found that all the
elephants had fled from the neighbourhood, except a young one which had
spent the night beside its dead mother. Seeing the huntsmen, it forgot
all fear, and came to meet them, with the clearest and most lively
signs of disconsolate grief, and put its tiny trunk about them, as if
to beg for help. "Then," says Harris, "I was filled with real remorse
for what I had done, and felt as if I had committed a murder."</p>

<p>The English nation, with its fine sensibility, is, in fact,
distinguished above all others for extraordinary compassion towards
animals, which appears at every opportunity, and is so strong that,
despite the "cold superstition" which otherwise degrades them, these
Anglo-Saxons have been led through its operation to fill up by
legislation the <i>lacuna</i> that their religion leaves in morality. For
this gap is precisely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> reason why in Europe and America there is
need of societies for the protection of animals, which are entirely
dependent on the law for their efficiency. In Asia the religions
themselves suffice, consequently no one there ever thinks of such
associations. Meanwhile Europeans are awakening more and more to a
sense that beasts have rights, in proportion as the strange notion
is being gradually overcome and outgrown, that the animal kingdom
came into existence solely for the benefit and pleasure of man. This
view,<a name="FNanchor_11_116" id="FNanchor_11_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_116" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> with the corollary that non-human living creatures are to be
regarded merely as things, is at the root of the rough and altogether
reckless treatment of them, which obtains in the West. To the honour,
then, of the English be it said that they are the first people who
have, in downright earnest, extended the protecting arm of the law to
animals: in England the miscreant, that commits an outrage on beasts,
has to pay for it, equally whether they are his own or not. Nor is this
all. There exists in London the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, a corporate body voluntarily formed, which, without state
assistance, and at great cost, is of no small service in lessening the
tale of tortures inflicted on animals. Its emissaries are ubiquitous,
and keep secret watch in order to inform against the tormentors of
dumb, sensitive creatures; and such persons have therefore good reason
to stand in fear of them.<a name="FNanchor_12_117" id="FNanchor_12_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_117" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> At all the steep bridges in London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> this
Society stations a pair of horses, which without any charge is attached
to heavy freight-waggons. Is not this admirable? Does it not elicit our
approval, as unfailingly as any beneficent action towards men? Also the
Philanthropic Society of London has done its part. In 1837 it offered a
prize of £30 for the best exposition of the moral reasons which exist
to keep men from torturing animals. The line of argument, however,
had to be taken almost exclusively from Christianity, whereby the
difficulty of the task was, of course, increased; but two years <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>later,
in 1839, Mr. Macnamara was the successful competitor. At Philadelphia
there is an Animals' Friends' Society, having the same aims; and it
is to the President of the latter that a book called <i>Philozoia; or,
Moral Reflections on the Actual Condition of Animals, and the Means
of Improving the Same</i> (Brussels, 1839), has been dedicated by its
author, T. Forster. It is original and well written. Mr. Forster
earnestly commends to his readers the humane treatment of animals. As
an Englishman he naturally tries to strengthen his position by the
support of the Bible; but he is on slippery ground, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>and meets with
such poor success that he ends by catching at the following ingenious
position: Jesus Christ (he says) was born in a stable among oxen and
asses; which was meant to indicate symbolically that we ought to regard
the beasts as our brothers, and treat them accordingly. All that I
have here adduced sufficiently proves that the moral chord, of which
we are speaking, is now at length beginning to vibrate also in the
West. For the rest, we may observe that compassion for sentient beings
is not to carry us to the length of abstaining from flesh, like the
Brahmans. This is because, by a natural law, capacity for pain keeps
pace with the intelligence; consequently men, by going without animal
food, especially in the North, would suffer more than beasts do through
a quick death, which is always unforeseen; although the latter ought
to be made still easier by means of chloroform. Indeed without meat
nourishment mankind would be quite unable to withstand the rigours of
the Northern climate. The same reasoning explains, too, why we are
right in making animals work for us; it is only when they are subjected
to an excessive amount of toil that cruelty begins.</p>

<p>(8) It is perhaps not impossible to investigate and explain
metaphysically the ultimate cause of that Compassion in which alone all
non-egoistic conduct can have its source; but let us for the moment put
aside such inquiries, and consider the phaenomenon in question, from
the empirical point of view, simply as a natural arrangement. Now if
Nature's intention was to soften as much as possible the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> numberless
sufferings of every sort, to which our life is exposed, and which no
one altogether escapes; if she wished to provide some counterbalance
for the burning Egoism, which fills all beings, and often develops into
malice; it will at once strike every one as obvious that she could not
have chosen any method more effectual than that of planting in the
human heart the wonderful disposition, which inclines one man to share
the pain of another, and from which proceeds the voice that bids us, in
tones strong and unmistakable, take thought for our neighbour; calling,
at one time, "Protect!" at another, "Help!" Assuredly, from the mutual
succour thus arising, there was more to be hoped for, towards the
attainment of universal well-being, than from a stern Command of duty,
couched in general, abstract terms,&mdash;the product of certain reasoning
processes, and of artificial combinations of conceptions. From such
an Imperative, indeed, all the less result could be expected because
to the rough human unit general propositions and abstract truths are
unintelligible, the concrete only having some meaning for him. And
it should be remembered that mankind in its entirety, a very small
part alone excepted, has always been rude, and must remain so, since
the large amount of bodily toil, which for the race as a whole is
inevitable, leaves no time for mental culture. Whereas, in order to
awaken that sense, which has been proved to be the sole source of
disinterested action, and consequently the true basis of Morals, there
is no need of abstract knowledge, but only of intuitive perception, of
the simple comprehension of a concrete case. To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> Compassion is at
once responsive, without the mediation of other thoughts.</p>

<p>(9) The following circumstance will be found in complete accord with
the last paragraph. The foundation, which I have given to Ethics,
leaves me without a forerunner among the School Philosophers; indeed,
my position is paradoxical, as far as their teaching goes, and many
of them, for instance, the Stoics (Seneca, <i>De Clementia</i>, II., 5),
Spinoza (<i>Ethica</i>, IV., prop. 50), and Kant (<i>Kritik der Praktischen
Vernunft,</i> p. 213; R. p. 257) only notice the motive of Compassion to
utterly reject and contemn it. On the other hand, my basis is supported
by the authority of the greatest moralist of modern times; for such,
undoubtedly, J. J. Rousseau is,&mdash;that profound reader of the human
heart, who drew his wisdom not from books, but from life, and intended
his doctrine not for the professorial chair, but for humanity; he,
the foe of all prejudice, the foster-child of nature, whom alone she
endowed with the gift of being able to moralise without tediousness,
because he hit the truth and stirred the heart. I shall therefore
venture here to cite some passages from his works in support of my
theory, observing that, so far, I have been as sparing as possible with
regard to quotations.</p>

<p>In the <i>Discours sur l'Origine de l'Inégalité</i>, p. 91 (edit. Bipont.),
he says: <i>Il y a un autre principe, que Hobbes n'a point aperçu, et qui
ayant été donné à l'homme pour adoucir, en certaines circonstances,
la férocité de son amour-propre, tempère l'ardeur qu'il a pour son

crois pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> avoir aucune contradiction à craindre en accordant à l'homme
la SEULE VERTU NATURELLE qu'ait été forcé de reconnaître le détracteur
le plus outré des vertus humaines. Je parle <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DE LA PITIÉ</span></i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_13_118" id="FNanchor_13_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_118" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>P. 92: <i>Mandeville a bien senti qu'avec toute leur morale les hommes
n'eussent jamais été que des monstres, si la nature ne leur eut donné
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">LA PITIÉ</span> à l'appui de la raison: mais il n'a pas vu, que <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DE CETTE SEULE

sinon LA PITIÉ, appliquée aux faibles, aux coupables, ou a l'espèce
humaine en général? La bienveillance et l'amitié même sont, à le bien
prendre, des productions d'une pitié constante, fixée sur un objet
particulier; car désirer que quelqu'un ne souffre point, qu'est-ce
autre chose, que désirer qu'il soit heureux?... La commisération sera
d'autant plus énergique, que <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">L'ANIMAL SPECTATEUR S'IDENTIFIERA</span> plus
intimement avec <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">L'ANIMAL SOUFFRANT</span>.</i><a name="FNanchor_14_119" id="FNanchor_14_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_119" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 94: <i>Il est donc bien certain, que la pitié est un sentiment
naturel, qui, modérant dans chaque individu l'amour de soi-même,
concourt à la conservation mutuelle de toute l'espèce. C'est elle, qui
dans l'état de nature, tient lieu de lois, de mœurs, et de vertus, avec
cet avantage, que nul ne sera tenté de désobéir à sa douce voix: c'est
elle, qui détournera tout sauvage robuste d'enlever à un faible enfant,
ou à un vieillard infirme, sa subsistence acquise avec peine, si lui
même espère pouvoir trouver la sienne ailleurs: c'est elle qui, au lieu
de cette maxime sublime de justice raisonnée: "Fais à autrui comme tu
veux qu'on te fasse;" inspire à tous les hommes cette autre maxime de
bonté naturelle, bien moins parfaite, mais plus utile peut-être que
la précédente: "Fais ton bien avec le moindre mal d'autrui qu'il est
possible." C'est, en un mot, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DANS CE SENTIMENT NATUREL PLUTÔT, QUE DANS
LES ARGUMENTS SUBTILS</span>, qu'il faut chercher la cause de la repugnance

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>Let this be compared with what he says in <i>Émile,</i> Bk. IV., pp. 115-120
(edit. Bipont.), where the following passage occurs among others:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>En effet, comment nous laissons-nous émouvoir à la pitié, si ce n'est

le resserrent, le concentrent, et tendent le ressort <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DU MOI HUMAIN</span></i>,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_16_121" id="FNanchor_16_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_121" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Inside the pale of the Schools, as above remarked, there is not a
single authority in favour of my position; but outside, I have other
testimony to cite, in addition to Rousseau's. The Chinese admit five
cardinal virtues (<span class="gesperrt">Tschang</span>), of which the chief is Compassion (<span class="gesperrt">Sin</span>).
The other four are: justice, courtesy, wisdom, and sincerity.<a name="FNanchor_17_122" id="FNanchor_17_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_122" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Similarly, among the Hindus, we find that on the tablets placed to
the memory of dead chieftains, compassion for men and animals takes
the first place in the record of their virtues. At Athens there was
an altar to Compassion in the Agora, as we know from Pausanias, I.
17: <i>Άθηναίοις δὲ ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ ἐστι Ἐλέου βωμός, ᾧ, μάλιστα θεῶν ἐς
ἀνθρώπινον βίον καὶ μεταβολὰς πραγμάτων ὃτι ὠ-ϕέλιμος, μόνοι τιμὰς
Ἑλλήνων νέμουσιν Ἀθηνᾱίοι</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18_123" id="FNanchor_18_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_123" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucian also mentions this altar in the Timon, § 99.<a name="FNanchor_19_124" id="FNanchor_19_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_124" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> A phrase of
Phocion, preserved by Stobaeus, describes Compassion as the most sacred
thing in human life: <i>οὕτε ἐξ ἱεροn βωμόν, οὕτε ἐκ τῆς ἀνθρωπίυης
ϕύσεως ἀϕαιρετέον τὸν ἔλεον.</i><a name="FNanchor_20_125" id="FNanchor_20_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_125" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In the <i>Sapientia Indorum,</i> the Greek
translation of the <span class="gesperrt">Paṅća-tantra</span>, we read (Section 3, p. 220): <i>Δέγεται
γάρ, ὡς πρώτη τῶν ἀρετῶν ἡ ἐλεημοσύνη</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21_126" id="FNanchor_21_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_126" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is clear, then, that the
real source of morality has been distinctly recognised at all times and
in all countries; Europe alone excepted, owing to the <i>foetor Judaicus</i>
(Jewish stench), which here pervades everything, and is the reason why
the Western races require for the object of their obedience a command
of duty, a moral law, an imperative, in short, an order and decree.
They remain wedded to this habit of thought, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> refuse to open their
eyes to the fact that such a view is, after all, based upon nothing
but Egosim. Of course, now and then, isolated individuals of fine
perception have felt the truth, and given it utterance: such a one was
Rousseau; and such, Lessing. In a letter written by the latter in 1756
we read: "The best man, and the one most likely to excel in all social
virtues, in all forms of magnanimity, is he who is most compassionate."</p>

eighty-four abettors of dog-fights.&mdash;It had come to the knowledge
of the Society of Animals' Friends that the Square in Fox Street,
Birmingham, was yesterday to be the scene of a dog-fight. Measures were
accordingly taken to secure the assistance of the police, and a strong
detachment of constables was sent to the spot. At the right moment all
the persons present were arrested. These precious conspirators were
then handcuffed together in pairs, and the whole party was made fast
by a long rope passing between each couple. In this fashion they were
marched off to the Police Station, where mayor and magistrate were
sitting in readiness for them. The two ringleaders were condemned to
pay, each, a fine of £1, and 8s. <i>6d</i>. costs; in default, to undergo
14 days' hard labour." The coxcombs whose habit is never to miss
noble sport of this sort, must have looked somewhat crestfallen in
the midst of the procession. But the <i>Times</i> of April 6, 1855, p. 6,
supplies a still more striking instance from the present day; and here
we find the paper itself assuming judicial functions, and imposing
the right punishment. It recounts the case of a very wealthy Scotch
baronet's daughter. The matter had been brought before the law, and
the evidence showed that the girl had used a cudgel and knife on her
horse with the greatest cruelty; for which she was ordered to pay a
fine of £5. But for one in her position such a sum means nothing, and
she would practically have got off scot-free, had not the <i>Times</i>
intervened to inflict on her a proper correction, such as she would
really feel. It twice mentions the young lady's name in full, printing
it in large type, and concludes as follows: "We cannot help saying
that a few months' imprisonment with the addition of an occasional
whipping administered in private, but by the most muscular woman in
Hampshire, would have been a much more suitable penalty for Miss M. N.
A wretched being of this sort has forfeited all the consideration and
the privileges that attach to her sex; we cannot regard her any longer
as a woman." These newspaper paragraphs I would especially recommend to
the notice of the associations now formed in Germany against cruelty to
animals; for they show what lines should be adopted, in order to reach
some solid result. At the same time I desire to express my cordial
appreciation of the praiseworthy zeal shown by Herrn Hofrath Perner, of
Munich, who has entirely devoted himself to this branch of well-doing,
and succeeded in arousing interest in it all over the country. [It
should be observed that the first portion of this note belongs to the
earliest edition of the work, published September, 1840; the latter
part was written for the second edition, which appeared in August,
1860. This explains why Schopenhauer says that the first instance,
dated 1839, is "quite recent," and that the second, dated 1855, is
taken "from the present day."&mdash;(<i>Translator</i>.)]</p></div>

at all. It was implanted in man in order to soften, in certain
circumstances, the fierceness of his self-love, and it moderates the
ardour, which he feels for his own well-being, by producing a certain
<i>innate aversion to the sight of a fellow-creature's suffering</i>. In
attributing to man <i>the only natural virtue,</i> which even the most
advanced scepticism has been forced to recognise, I stand, assuredly,
in no fear of any contradiction. I allude to <i>compassion</i>, etc.</p></div>

systems of morality, men would never have been anything but monsters,
if nature had not given them <i>compassion</i> to support their reason; but
he failed to see that <i>from this one quality spring all the social
virtues</i>, which he was unwilling to credit mankind with. In reality,
what is generosity, clemency, humanity, if not <i>compassion</i>, applied
to the weak, to the guilty, or to the human race, as a whole? Even
benevolence and friendship, if we look at the matter rightly, are
seen to result from a constant compassion, directed upon a particular
object; for to desire that some one should not suffer is nothing else
than to desire that he should be happy.... The more closely <i>the living
spectator identifies himself with the living sufferer,</i> the more active
does pity become.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15_120" id="Footnote_15_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_120"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> It is, then, quite certain that compassion is a natural
feeling, which checking, as it does, the love of self in each
individual, helps by a reciprocal process to preserve the whole race.
This it is, which in the state of nature, takes the place of laws,
customs, and virtues, with the added advantage that no one will be
tempted to disobey its gentle voice; this it is, which will restrain
every able-bodied savage, provided he hope to find his own livelihood
elsewhere, from robbing a weak child, or depriving an infirm old man of
the subsistence won by hard toil; this it is, which inspires all men,
not indeed with that sublime maxim of reasoned justice: "Do to others
as you would they should do unto you;" but with another rule of natural
goodness, no doubt less perfect, but perhaps more useful, namely: "Do
what is good for yourself with the least possible harm to others." In a
word, it is <i>in this natural feeling rather than in subtle arguments</i>
that we must look for the reason of the repugnance with which every
one is accustomed to view bad conduct, quite independently of the
principles laid down by education.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IXc" id="CHAPTER_IXc">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p>ON THE ETHICAL DIFFERENCE OF CHARACTER.</p>


<p>There still remains a question to be resolved, before the basis which
I have given to Ethics can be presented in all its completeness. It
is this. On what does the great difference in the moral behaviour of
men rest? If Compassion be the original incentive of all true, that
is, disinterested justice and loving-kindness; how comes it that some
are, while others are not, influenced thereby? Are we to suppose that
Ethics, which discloses the moral stimulus, is also capable of setting
it in motion? Can Ethics fashion the hard-hearted man anew, so that
he becomes compassionate, and, as a consequence, just and humane?
Certainly not. The difference of character is innate, and ineradicable.
The wicked man is born with his wickedness as much as the serpent is
with its poison-fangs and glands, nor can the former change his nature
a whit more than the latter.<a name="FNanchor_1_127" id="FNanchor_1_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_127" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>Velle non discitur</i> (to use one's will
is not a thing that can be taught) is a saying of Nero's tutor. In the
<i>Meno</i>, Plato minutely investigates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> the nature of virtue, and inquires
whether it can, or cannot, be taught. He quotes a passage from Theognis:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 15%;">
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;"><i>ἀλλὰ διδάσκων</i></span><br />
<i>Οὔποτε ποιήσεις τὸν κακὸν ἄνδρ' ἀγαθόν.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">(But thou wilt ne'er,</span><br />
By teaching make the bad man virtuous.)<br />
</p>

<p>and finally reaches this conclusion: <i>ἀρετὴ ἃν εἴη oὔτε ϕύσει,
oὔτε διδακτόν, ἀλλὰ θείᾳ μοίρᾳ παραγυγνομένη, ἄνευ νοῡ, οἷς ἄν
παραγίγνηται</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_128" id="FNanchor_2_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_128" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Here the terms <i>ϕύσει</i> and <i>θείᾳ μοίρᾳ</i>, form a
distinction, in my opinion, much the same as that between "physical"
and "metaphysical." Socrates, the father of Ethics, if we may trust
Aristotle, declared that <i>oὐκ ἐϕ' ἡ μῑν γενέσθαι τὸ σπουδαίους εἶναι,
ἢ ϕαύλους.</i><a name="FNanchor_3_129" id="FNanchor_3_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_129" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (<i>Moralia Magna</i>, i. 9.) Moreover, Aristotle himself
expresses the same view; <i>παςι γὰρ δοκεῑ ἕκαστα τῶν ἠθῶν ὑπάρχειν
ϕύσει τως' καὶ γὰρ δίκαιοι, καὶ σωϕρονικοὶ, καὶ τἄλλa ἔχομεν εὐθyς
ἐκ γενετῆς.</i><a name="FNanchor_4_130" id="FNanchor_4_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_130" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (<i>Eth. Nicom.</i> vi. 13.) We find also a similar
conviction very decidedly expressed in the fragments attributed
to the Pythagorean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> Archytas, and preserved by Stobaeus in the
<i>Florilegium</i> (Chap. i. § 77).<a name="FNanchor_5_131" id="FNanchor_5_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_131" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> If not authentic, they are certainly
very old. Orelli gives them in his <i>Opuscula Graecorum Sententiosa et
Moralia</i>. There (Vol. II., p. 240) we read in the Dorian dialect as
follows:&mdash;<i>Τὰς γὰρ λόγοις καὶ ἀποδείξεσιν ποτιχρωμένας ἀρετὰς δέον
έπιστάμας ποταγορεύεν, ἀρετὰν δέ, τὰν ἠθικὰν καὶ βελτίσταν ἕξιν τῶ
ἀλόγω μέρεος τᾱς ·ψυχᾱς, καθ' ἃν καὶ ποιοί τινες ἦμεν λεγόμεθα κατὰ
τὸ ἦθος, οἷον ἐλευθέριοι, δίκαιοι καὶ σώϕρονες</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_132" id="FNanchor_6_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_132" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> On examining the
virtues and vices, as summarised by Aristotle in the <i>De Virtutibus
et Vitiis</i>, it will be found that all of them, without exception, are
not properly thinkable unless assumed to be inborn qualities, and
that only as such can they be genuine. If, in consequence of reasoned
reflection, we take them as voluntary, they are then seen to lose their
reality, and pass into the region of empty forms; whence it immediately
follows that their permanence and resistance under the storm and stress
of circumstance could not be counted on. And the same is true of the
virtue of loving-kindness, of which Aristotle, in common with all the
ancients, knows nothing. Montaigne keeps, of course, his sceptical
tone, but he practically agrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> with the venerable authorities
above quoted, when he says: <i>Serait-il vrai, que pour être bon tout
à fait, il nous le faille être par occulte, naturelle et universelle
propriété, sans lot, sans raison, sans exemple</i>?<a name="FNanchor_7_133" id="FNanchor_7_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_133" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;(Liv. II., chap.
11.) Lichtenberg hits the mark exactly in his <i>Vermischte Schriften</i>,
(<i>v. Moralische Bemerkungen</i>). He writes: "All virtue arising from
premeditation is not worth much. What is wanted is feeling or habit."
Lastly, it should be noted that Christianity itself, in its original
teaching, recognises, and bears witness to this inherent, immutable
difference between character and character. In the Sermon on the Mount
we find the allegory of the fruit which is determined by the nature of
the tree that bears it (<i>Luke</i> vi. 43, 44; cf. <i>Matthew</i> vii. 16-18);
and then in the following verse (<i>Luke</i> vi. 45), we read: <i>ὁ ἀγαθὸς
ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τοῡ ἀγαθοῡ θησαυροῡ τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῡ προϕέρει τὸ ἀγαθὸν
καὶ ὁ πονμρὸς ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τοῡ πoνηροῡ θησαυροῡ τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῡ
προϕέρει τὸπονηρόν.</i><a name="FNanchor_8_134" id="FNanchor_8_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_134" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (Cf. <i>Matthew</i> xii. 35.)</p>

<p>But it was Kant who first completely cleared up this important
point through his profound doctrine of the <b>empirical</b> and
<b>intelligible</b><a name="FNanchor_9_135" id="FNanchor_9_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_135" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> character. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> showed that the empirical
character, which manifests itself in time and in multiplicity
of action, is a phaenomenon; while the reality behind it is the
intelligible character, which, being the essential constitution of the
Thing in itself underlying the phaenomenon, is independent of time,
space, plurality, and change. In this way alone can be explained what
is so astonishing, and yet so well known to all who have learnt life's
lessons,&mdash;the fixed unchangeableness of human character. There are
certain ethical writers, whose aim is the moral improvement of men, and
who talk of progress made in the path of virtue; but their assurances
are always met and victoriously confuted by the irrefragable facts
of experience, which prove that virtue is nature's work and cannot
be inculcated. The character is an original datum, immutable, and
incapable of any amelioration through correction by the intellect. Now,
were this not so; and further: if (as the above-mentioned dull-headed
preachers maintain) an improvement of the character, and hence "a
constant advance towards the good" were possible by means of moral
instruction; then, unless we are prepared to suppose that all the
various religious institutions, and all the efforts of the moralists
fail in their purpose, we should certainly expect to find that the
older half of mankind, at least on an average, is distinctly better
than the younger. This, however, is so far from being the case, that it
is not to the old, who have, as we see, grown worse by experience, but
to the young that we look for something good. It may happen that in his
old age one man appears somewhat better, another worse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> than he was in
his youth. But the reason is not far to seek. It is simply because with
length of days the intelligence by constant correction becomes riper,
and hence the character stands out in purer and clearer shape; while
early life is a prey to ignorance, mistakes, and chimeras, which now
present false motives, and now veil the real. For a fuller explanation
I would refer the reader to the principles laid down in Chapter III. of
the preceding Essay, on "The Freedom of the Will."<a name="FNanchor_10_136" id="FNanchor_10_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_136" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is true that
among convicts the young have a large majority; but this is because,
when a tendency to crime exists in the character, it soon finds a way
of expressing itself in acts, and of reaching its goal&mdash;the galleys, or
the gibbet; while he, whom all the inducements to wrong doing, which
a long life offers, have failed to lead astray, is not likely to fall
at the eleventh hour. Hence the respect paid to age is, in my opinion,
due to the fact that the old are considered to have passed through a
test of sixty or seventy years, and kept their integrity unsullied; for
this of course is the <i>sine qua non</i> of the honour accorded them. These
things are too well known for any one, in real life, to be misled by
the promises of the moralists we have spoken of. He who has once been
proved guilty of evil-doing, is never again trusted, just as the noble
nature, of which a man has once given evidence, is always confidently
believed in, whatever else may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> have changed. <i>Operari sequitur esse</i>
(what one does follows from what one is) forms, as we have seen in Part
II., Chapter VIII., a pregnant tenet of the Schoolmen. Everything in
the world works according to the unchangeable constitution of which
its being, its <b>essentia</b> is composed. And man is no exception.
As the individual is, so will he, so must he, act: and the <i>liberum
arbitrium indifferentiae</i> (free and indifferent choice) is an invention
of philosophy in her childhood, long since exploded; although there
are some old women, in doctor's academicals, who still like to drag it
about with them.</p>

<p>The three fundamental springs of human action&mdash;Egoism, Malice,
Compassion&mdash;are inherent in every one in different and strangely
unequal proportions. Their combination in any given case determines
the weight of the motives that present themselves, and shapes the
resulting line of conduct. To an egoistic character egoistic motives
alone appeal, and those, which suggest either compassion or malice,
have no appreciable effect. Thus, a man of this type will sacrifice
his interests as little to take vengeance on his foes, as to help his
friends. Another, whose nature is highly susceptible to malicious
motives, will not shrink from doing great harm to himself, so only he
may injure his neighbour. For there are characters which take such
delight in working mischief on others, that they forget their own
loss, which is perhaps, equal to what they inflict. One may say of
such: <i>Dum alteri noceat sui negligens</i><a name="FNanchor_11_137" id="FNanchor_11_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_137" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (disregarding himself so
long as he injures the other). These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> the people that plunge with
passionate joy into the battle in which they expect to receive quite
as many wounds as they deal; indeed, experience not seldom testifies
that they are ready deliberately, first to kill the man who thwarts
their purposes, and then themselves, in order to escape the penalty
of the law. On the other hand, <b>goodness of heart</b> consists of a
deeply felt, all-embracing Compassion for everything that has breath,
and especially for man; because, in proportion as the intelligence
develops, capacity for pain increases; and hence, the countless
sufferings of human beings, in mind and body, have a much stronger
claim to Compassion than those of animals, which are only physical,
and in any case less acute. This goodness of heart, therefore, in the
first place restrains a man from doing any sort of harm to others, and,
next, it bids him give succour whenever and wherever he sees distress.
And the path of Compassion may lead as far in one direction as Malice
does in the other. Certain rare characters of fine sensibility take to
heart the calamities of others more than their own, so that they make
sacrifices, which, it may be, entail on themselves a greater amount
of suffering than that removed from those they benefit. Nay, in cases
where several, or, perhaps, a large number of persons, at one time,
can be helped in this way, such men do not, if need be, flinch from
absolute self-effacement. Arnold von Winkelried was one of these. So
was Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, in the fifth century, when the Vandals
crossed over from Africa and invaded Italy. Of him we read in Johann
von Müller's <i>Weltgeschichte</i> (Bk. X., chap. 10)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> that "in order to
ransom some of the prisoners, he had already disposed of all the church
plate, his own and his friends' private property. Then, on seeing the
anguish of a widow, whose only son was being carried off, he offered
himself for servitude in the other's stead. For whoever was of suitable
age, and had not fallen by the sword, was taken captive to Carthage."</p>

<p>There is, then, an enormous difference between character and character.
Being original and innate, it measures the responsiveness of the
individual to this or that motive, and those alone, to which he is
specially sensitive, will appeal to him with anything like compelling
force. As in chemistry, with unchangeable certainty, one substance
reacts only upon acids, another only upon alkalies, so, with equal
invariableness, different natures respond to different stimuli. The
motives suggesting loving-kindness, which stir so deeply a good
disposition, can, of themselves, effect nothing in a heart that listens
only to the promptings of Egoism. If it be wished to induce the egoist
to act with beneficence and humanity, this can be done but in one way:
he must be made to believe that the assuaging of others' suffering
will, somehow or other, surely turn out to his <b>own advantage</b>.
What, indeed, are most moral systems but attempts of different kinds in
this direction? But such procedure only misleads, does not better, the
will. To make a real improvement, it would be necessary to transform
the entire nature of the individual's susceptibility for motives. Thus,
from one we should have to remove his indifference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> suffering
of others as such; from another, the delight which he feels in causing
pain; from a third, the natural tendency which makes him regard the
smallest increase of his own well-being as so far outweighing all other
motives, that the latter become as dust in the balance. Only it is far
easier to change lead into gold than to accomplish such a task. For
it means the turning round, so to say, of a man's heart in his body,
the remoulding of his very being. In point of fact, all that can be
done is to clear the <b>intellect</b>, correct the <b>judgment</b>,
and so bring him to a better comprehension of the objective realities
and actual relations of life. This effected, the only result gained is
that his will reveals itself more logically, distinctly, and decidedly,
with no false ring in its utterance. It should be noted that just as
many a good act rests at bottom on false motives, on well-meant, yet
illusory representations of an advantage to be obtained thereby in
this, or another, world; so not a few misdeeds are due solely to an
imperfect understanding of the conditions of human life. It is on this
latter truth that the American penitentiary system is based. Here the
aim is not, to improve the <b>heart</b>, but simply, to educate the
<b>head</b> of the criminal, so that he may intellectually come to
perceive that prosperity is more surely, indeed more easily, reached by
work and honesty than by idleness and knavery.</p>

<p>By the proper presentment of motives <b>legality</b> may be secured,
but not <b>morality</b>. It is possible to remodel what one does, but
not what one <b>wills to do</b>; and it is to the will alone that
real moral worth belongs. It is not possible to change the goal which
the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> strives after, but only the path expected to lead thither.
Instruction may alter the selection of means, but not the choice of
the ultimate object which the individual keeps before him in all he
does; this is determined by his will in accordance with its original
nature. It is true that the egoist may be brought to understand that,
if he gives up certain small advantages, he will gain greater; and the
malicious man may be taught that by injuring others he will injure
himself still more. But Egoism itself, and Malice itself, will never
be argued out of a person; as little as a cat can be talked out of her
inclination for mice. Similarly with goodness of heart. If the judgment
be trained, if the relations and conditions of life become understood,
in a word, if the intellect be enlightened; the character dominated by
loving-kindness will be led to express itself more consistently and
completely than it otherwise could. This happens when we perceive the
remoter consequences which our conduct has for others: the sufferings,
perhaps, that overtake them indirectly, and only after lapse of
time, through one act or another of ours, which we had no idea was
so harmful. It occurs, too, when we come to discern the evil results
of many a well-meant action, as, for instance, the screening of a
criminal; and it is especially true when we realise that the <i>Neminem
laede</i> (injure no one) has in all cases precedence over the <i>Omnes
juva</i> (help all men). In this sense there is undoubtedly such a thing
as a moral education, an ethical training capable of making men better.
But it goes only as far as I have indicated, and its limits are quickly
discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> The head is filled with the light of knowledge; the heart
remains unimproved. The fundamental and determining element, in things
moral, no less than in things intellectual, and things physical, is
that which is inborn. Art is always subordinate, and can only lend a
helping hand. Each man is, what he is, as it were, "by the grace of
God," <i>jure divino, θείᾳ, μοίρᾳ</i>, (by divine dispensation).</p>

<p>But the reader, I am sure, has long been wishing to
put the question: Where, then, does blame and merit
come in? The answer is fully contained in Part IL,
Chapter VIII., to which I therefore beg to call
particular attention. It is there that the explanation,
which otherwise would now follow, found a natural
place; because the matter is closely connected with
Kant's doctrine of the co-existence of Freedom and
Necessity. Our investigation led to the conclusion
that, once the motives are brought into play, the
<i>Operari</i> (what, is done) is a thing of absolute
necessity; consequently, Freedom, the existence of
which is betokened solely by the sense of <b>responsibility</b>,
cannot but belong to the <i>Esse</i> (what one is).
No doubt the reproaches of conscience have to do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
in the first place, and ostensibly, with our acts, but
through these they, in reality, reach down to what
we are; for what we do is the only indisputable
index of what we <b>are</b>, and reflects our character just
as faithfully as symptoms betray the malady. Hence
it is to this <i>Esse</i>, to what we <b>are</b>, that blame and
merit must ultimately be attributed. Whatever we
esteem and love, or else despise and hate, in others,
is not a changeable, transient appearance, but something
constant, stable, and persistent; it is that
which they are. If we find reason to alter our first
opinion about any one, we do not suppose that he
is changed, but that we have been mistaken in him.
In like manner, when we are pleased or displeased
with our own conduct, we say that we are satisfied
or dissatisfied with ourselves, meaning, in reality,
with that which we are, and are unalterably, irreversibly;
and the same is true with regard to our
intellectual qualities, nay, it even applies to the
physiognomy. How is it possible, then, for blame
and merit to lie otherwise than in what we <b>are</b>? As
we saw in Part II., Chapter VII., Conscience is that
<b>register</b> of our acts, which is always growing longer,
and therefore that acquaintance with ourselves which
every day becomes more complete. Conscience concerns
itself directly with all that we do; when, at
one time, actuated by Egoism, or perhaps Malice,
we turn a deaf ear to Compassion, which bids us at
least refrain from harming others, if we will not
afford them help and protection; or when again, at
another time, we overcome the first two incentives,
and listen to the voice of the third. Both cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
measure the <b>distinction</b> we <b>draw between ourselves
and others</b>. And on <b>this distinction</b> depends in the
last resort the degree of our morality or immorality,
that is, of our justice and loving-kindness, or the
reverse. Little by little the number of those
actions, whose testimony is significant on this point,
accumulates in the storehouse of our memory; and
thus the lineaments of our character are depicted
with ever greater clearness, and a true knowledge of
ourselves is nearer attainment. And out of such
knowledge there springs a sense of satisfaction, or
dissatisfaction with ourselves, with that which we
are, according as we have been ruled by Egoism,
by Malice, or else by Compassion; in other words,
according as the difference we have made between
ourselves and others is greater or smaller. And
when we look outside ourselves, it is by the same
standard that we judge those about us; and we become
acquainted with their character&mdash;less perfectly
indeed&mdash;yet by the same empirical method as we
employ with reference to our own. In this case our
feelings take the form of praise, approval, respect, or,
on the other hand, of reproach, displeasure, contempt,
and they are the objective translation, so to say,
of the subjective satisfaction or dissatisfaction (the
latter deepening perhaps into remorse), which arises
in us when we sit in judgment on ourselves. Lastly,
there is the evidence of language. We find certain
constantly occurring forms of speech which bear
eloquent testimony to the fact that the blame we
cast upon others is in reality directed against their
unchangeable character, touching but superficially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
what they do; that virtue and vice are practically,
if tacitly, regarded as inherent unalterable qualities.
The following are some of these expressions: <i>Jetzt
sehe ich, wie du bist</i>! (Now I know your nature!)
<i>In dir habe ich mich geirrt</i>. (I was mistaken
in you.) "Now I see what you are!" <i>Voilà
donc, comme tu es!</i> (This, then, is what you are!)
<i>So bin ich nicht!</i> (I am not a person of that
sort!) <i>Ich bin nicht der Mann, der fähig wäre,
Sie zu hintergehen</i>. (I am not the man to impose
upon you.) Also: <i>les âmes bien nées</i> (persons well-born,
<i>i.e.</i>, noble-minded), the Spanish <i>bien nacido;
εὐγενής</i> (properly "well-born"), <i>εὐγένεια</i> (properly
"nobility of birth") used for "virtuous" and
"virtue"; <i>generosioris animi amicus</i> (a friend of
lofty mind. <i>Generosus</i>: lit. "of noble birth"), etc.</p>

<p>Reason is a necessary condition for conscience,
but only because without the former a clear and
connected recollection is impossible. From its very
nature conscience does not speak till <b>after</b> the act;
hence we talk of being arraigned before its <b>bar</b>.
Strictly speaking, it is improper to say that conscience
speaks <b>beforehand</b>; for it can only do so
indirectly; that is, when the remembrance of particular
cases in the past leads us, through reflection,
to disapprove of some analogous course of action,
while yet in embryo.</p>

<p>Such is the ethical fact as delivered by consciousness.
It forms of itself a metaphysical problem,
which does not directly belong to the present question,
but which will be touched on in the last part.</p>

<p>Conscience, then, is nothing else than the acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
we make with our own changeless character
through the instrumentality of our acts. A little
consideration will show that this definition harmonises
perfectly with, and hence receives additional
confirmation from, what I have here specially emphasised:
namely, the fact that <b>susceptibility</b> for the
motives of Egoism, of Malice, and of Compassion,
which is so widely dissimilar in different individuals,
and on which the whole moral value of a man
depends, cannot be interpreted by anything else,
nor be gained, or removed, by instruction, as if it
were something born in time, and therefore variable,
and subject to chance. On the contrary, we have
seen that it is innate and fixed, an ultimate datum,
admitting of no further explanation. Thus an entire
life, with the whole of its manifold activity, may
be likened to a clock-dial, that marks every movement
of the internal works, as they were made once
for all; or it resembles a mirror, wherein alone,
with the eye of his intellect, each person sees reflected
the essential nature of his own Will, that
is, the core of his being.</p>

<p>Whoever takes the trouble to thoroughly think
out what has been put forward here, and in Part. II.,
Chapter VIII., will discover in the foundation given by
me to Ethics a logical consecution, a rounded completeness,
wanting to all other theories; to say
nothing of the consonance of my view with the facts
of experience,&mdash;a consonance which he will look for
in vain elsewhere. For only the truth can uniformly
and consistently agree with itself and with nature;
while all false principles are internally at variance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
themselves, and externally contradict the testimony
of experience, which at every step records its silent
protest.</p>

<p>I am perfectly aware that the truths advanced
in this Essay, and particularly here at the close,
strike directly at many deeply rooted prejudices and
mistakes, and especially at those attaching to a certain
rudimentary system of morals, now much in vogue,
and suitable for elementary schools. But I cannot
own to feeling any penitence or regret. For, in the
first place, I am addressing neither children, nor the
<i>profanum vulgus</i>, but an Academy of light and
learning. Their inquiry is a purely theoretical one,
concerned with the ultimate fundamental verities
of Ethics; and to a most serious question a serious
answer is undoubtedly expected. And secondly, in
my opinion, there can be no such thing as harmless
mistakes, still less privileged or useful ones. On
the contrary, every error works infinitely more evil
than good. If, however, it is wished to make existing
prepossessions the standard of truth, or the boundary
beyond which its investigation is not to go, then
it would be more honest to abolish philosophical
Faculties and Academies altogether. For where no
reality exists, there also no semblance of it should be.</p>

<h3>HOW THIS APPENDIX MUST BE UNDERSTOOD.</h3>


<p>In the foregoing pages the moral incentive (Compassion) has been
established as a fact, and I have shown that from it alone can proceed
unselfish justice and genuine loving-kindness, and that on these two
cardinal virtues all the rest depend. Now, for the purpose of supplying
Ethics with a foundation, this is sufficient, in a certain sense; that
is, in so far as Moral Science necessarily requires to be supported by
some actual and demonstrable basis, whether existing in the external
world, or in the consciousness. The only alternative is to tread in the
footsteps that so many of my predecessors have left, in other words, to
choose arbitrarily some proposition or other,&mdash;some bare and abstract
formula&mdash;and make it the source of all that morality prescribes;
or, like Kant, to sublimate a mere idea, that of <b>law</b>, into
the key-stone of the ethical arch. But, dismissing this method for
the reasons discussed above, in the Second Part, the investigation
proposed by the Royal Society appears to me now completed. For their
question, as it stands, deals only with the foundation of Ethics; as
to a possible metaphysical explanation of this foundation nothing
whatever is asked. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> at the point we have reached, I am
very sensible that the human spirit can find no abiding satisfaction,
no real repose. As in all branches of practical research, so also
in Ethical Science, when all is said, man is inevitably confronted
with an ultimate phaenomenon, which while it renders an account
of everything that it includes, and everything deducible from it,
remains itself an unexplained riddle. So that here, as elsewhere, the
want is felt of a final interpretation (which, obviously, cannot but
be <b>metaphysical</b>) of the ultimate data, as such, and through
these,&mdash;if they be taken in their entirety&mdash;of the world. And here,
too, this want finds utterance in the question: How is it that, what
is present to our senses, and grasped by our intellect, is as it is,
and not otherwise? And how does the character of the phaenomenon, as
manifest to us, shape itself out of the essential nature of things?
Indeed, in Moral Science the need of a metaphysical basis is more
urgent than in any other, because all systems, philosophical no less
than religious, are at one in persistently attaching to <b>conduct</b>
not only an ethical, but also a metaphysical significance, which,
passing beyond the mere appearance of things, transcends every
possibility of experience, and therefore stands in the closest
connection with human destiny and with the whole cosmic process. For
if life (it is averred) have a meaning, then the supreme goal to which
it points is undoubtedly ethical. Nor is this view a bare unsupported
theory; it is sufficiently established by the undeniable fact that,
as death draws nigh, the thoughts of each individual assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> a moral
trend, equally whether he be credulous of religious dogmas, or not;
he is manifestly anxious to wind up the affairs of his life, now
verging to its end, entirely from the <b>moral</b> standpoint. In
this particular the testimony of the ancients is of special value,
standing, as they do, outside the pale of Christian influence. I shall
therefore here quote a remarkable passage preserved by Stobaeus, in his
<i>Florilegium</i> (chap. 44, §. 20). It has been attributed to the earliest
Hellenic lawgiver, Zaleucus, though, according to Bentley and Heyne,
its source is Pythagorean. The language is graphic and unmistakable.
<i>Δεῑ τίθεσθαι πρὸ ὀμμάτων τὸν καιρὸν τοῡτον, ἐν ᾧ γίγνεται τὸ τέλος
ἑκάστῳ τῆς ἀπαλλαγς τοῡ ξῆν. Πᾱσι γὰρ ἐμπίπτει μεταμέλεια τοῑς μέλλουσι
τελευτᾱν, μεμνημένοις ὧν ἠδικήκασι, καὶ ὁρμὴ τοῡ βούλεσθαι πάντα
πεπράχθαι δικαίως αὐτοῑς</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_139" id="FNanchor_1_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_139" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, to come to an historical personage, we find Pericles, on
his death-bed, unwilling to hear anything about his great achievements,
and only anxious to know that he had never brought trouble on a
citizen. (Plutarch, <i>Life of Pericles</i>.) Turning to modern times, if
a very different case may be placed beside the preceding, I remember
having noticed in a report of depositions made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> before an English jury
the following occurrence. A rough negro lad, fifteen years old, had
been mortally injured in some brawl on board a ship. As he was dying,
he eagerly begged that all his companions might be fetched in haste:
he wanted to ask if he had ever vexed or insulted any one of them, and
after hearing that he had not, his mind appeared greatly relieved. It
is indeed the uniform teaching of experience that those near death wish
to be reconciled with every one before they pass away.</p>

<p>But there is evidence of another kind that Ethics can only be finally
explained by Metaphysics. It is well known that, while the author of an
intellectual performance,&mdash;even should it be a supreme masterpiece&mdash;is
quite willing to take whatever remuneration he can get, those, on the
other hand, who have done something morally excellent, almost without
exception, refuse compensation for it. The latter fact is specially
observable where conduct rises to the heroic. For instance, when a
man at the risk of his life has saved another, or perhaps many, from
destruction, as a rule, he simply declines all reward, poor though he
may be; because he instinctively feels that the metaphysical value
of his act would be thereby impaired. At the end of Bürger's song,
"The Brave Man," we find a poetical presentment of this psychological
process. Nor does the reality, for the most part, differ at all from
the ideal, as I have frequently noticed in English papers. Conduct
of this kind occurs in every part of the world, and independently of
all religious differences. In human beings there is an undeniable
ethical tendency, rooted (however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> unconsciously) in Metaphysics, and
without an explanation of life on these lines, no religion could gain
standing-ground; for it is by virtue of their ethical side that they
all alike keep their hold on the mind. Every religion makes its body
of dogmas the basis of the moral incentive which each man feels, but
which he does not, on that account, understand; and it unites the two
so closely, that they appear to be inseparable. Indeed the priests take
special pains to proclaim unbelief and immorality as one and the same
thing. The reason is thus apparent, why believers regard unbelievers
as identical with the vicious, and why expressions such as "godless,"
"atheistic," "unchristian," "heretic," etc., are used as synonymes
for moral depravity. The religions have, in fact, a sufficiently easy
task. <b>Faith</b> is the principle they start from. Hence they are
in a position to simply insist on its application to their dogmas,
and this, even to the point of employing threats. But philosophy
has no such convenient instrument ready to hand. If the different
systems be examined, it will be found that the situation is beset with
difficulties, both as regards the foundation to be provided for Ethics,
and in relation to the point of connection discoverable in any such
foundation with the given metaphysical theory. And yet,&mdash;as I have
emphasised in the introduction, with an appeal to the authority of
Wolff and Kant&mdash;we are under the stringent necessity of obtaining from
Metaphysics a support for Moral Science.</p>

<p>Now, of all the problems that the human intellect has to grapple with,
that of Metaphysics is by far the hardest; so much so that it is
regarded by many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> thinkers as absolutely insoluble. Apart from this,
in the present case, I labour under the special disadvantage which
the form of a detached monograph involves. In other words, I am not
at liberty to start from some definite metaphysical system, of which
I may be an adherent; because, if I did, either it would have to be
expounded in detail, which would take too much space; or else there
would be the necessity of supposing it granted and unquestioned,&mdash;an
exceedingly precarious proceeding. The consequence is that I am as
little able to use the synthetic method here as in the foregoing Part.
Analysis alone is possible: that is, I must work backwards from the
effects to their cause, and not <i>vice versâ</i>. This stern obligation,
however, of having at the outset no previous hypothesis, no standpoint
other than the commonly accepted one, made the discovery of the ethical
basis so laborious that, as I look back upon the task, I seem to have
accomplished some wondrous feat of dexterity, not unlike that of a man
who executes with subtlest skill in mid air what otherwise is only
done on a solid support. But now that we have come to the question
whether there can be given a metaphysical explanation of the foundation
obtained, the difficulty of proceeding without any assumption becomes
so enormous, that but one course appears to me open, namely, to attempt
nothing beyond a general sketch of the subject. I shall, therefore,
indicate rather than elaborate the line of thought: I shall point out
the way leading to the goal, but not follow it thither; in short, I
shall present but a very small part of what, under other circumstances,
could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> adduced. In adopting this attitude for the reasons stated, I
wish, before beginning, to emphatically remark, that in any case the
actual problem put forward has now been solved; consequently, that what
I here add is an <i>opus supererogationis</i>, an appendix to be given and
taken entirely at will.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IId" id="CHAPTER_IId">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<h3>THE METAPHYSICAL GROUNDWORK.</h3>
<hr class="r5" />

<p>So far all our steps have been supported by the firm rock of
experience. But at this point it fails us, and the solid earth sinks
from under our feet, as we press forward in our search after a final
theoretical satisfaction, there, where no experience can ever by any
possibility penetrate; and happy shall we be, if perchance we gain
one hint, one transient gleam, that may bring us a certain measure
of content. What, however, shall not desert us is the honesty that
has hitherto attended our procedure. We shall not make shift with
dreams, and serve up fairy tales, after the fashion of the so-called
post-Kantian philosophers; nor shall we, like them, seek, by a wordy
exuberance, to impose upon the reader, and cast dust in his eyes. A
little is all we promise; but that little will be presented in perfect
sincerity.</p>

<p>The principle, which we discovered to be the final explanation of
Ethics, now in turn itself requires explaining; so that our present
problem has to deal with that natural Compassion, which in every man
is innate and indestructible, and which has been shown to be the sole
source of <b>non-egoistic</b> conduct, this kind alone being of real
moral worth. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> many modern thinkers treat the conceptions of Good
and Bad as <b>simple</b>, that is, as neither needing, nor admitting
any elucidation, and then they go on, for the most part, to talk very
mysteriously and devoutly of an "Idea of the Good," out of which
they make a pedestal for their moral system, or at least a cloak for
their poverty.<a name="FNanchor_1_140" id="FNanchor_1_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_140" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Hence I am obliged in this connection to point out
parenthetically, that these conceptions are anything but <b>simple</b>,
much less <i>a priori</i>; that they in fact express a relation, and are
derived from the commonest daily experience. Whatever is in conformity
with the desires of any individual will, is, relatively to it, termed
<b>good</b>; for instance, good food, good roads, a good omen; the
contrary is called <b>bad</b>, and, in the case of living beings,
<b>malicious</b>. And so one, who by virtue of his character, has
no wish to oppose what others strive after, but rather, as far as
he reasonably may, shows himself favourable and helpful to them;
one, who, instead of injuring, assists his neighbours, and promotes
their interests, when he can; is named by the latter, in respect to
themselves, a <b>good man</b>; the term <b>good</b> being applied to
him in the sense of the above definition, and from their own point of
view, which is thus relative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> empirical, and centred in the passive
subject. Now, if we examine the nature of such a man, not only as it
affects others, but as it is in itself, we are enabled by the foregoing
exposition to perceive that the virtues of justice and loving-kindness,
which he practises, are due to a direct participation in weal and
woe external to himself; and we have learnt that the source of such
participation is Compassion. If, further, we pause to consider what is
the essential part in this type of character, we shall certainly find
it to lie in the fact that such a person <b>draws less distinction
between himself and others than is usually done</b>.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the malicious individual this difference is so great
that he takes direct delight in the spectacle of suffering,&mdash;a delight,
which he accordingly seeks without thought of any other benefit to
himself, nay, sometimes, even to his own hurt. From the egoist's point
of view the same difference is still large enough to make him bring
much trouble on his neighbours, in order to obtain a small personal
advantage. Hence for both of these, between the <b>ego</b>, which is
limited to their own persons, and the <b>non-ego</b>, which includes
all the rest of the world, there is fixed a great gulf, a mighty abyss:
<i>Pereat mundus, dum ego salvus sim</i> (the world may perish, provided
I be safe), is their maxim. For the good man, on the contrary, this
distinction is by no means so pronounced; indeed, in the case of
magnanimous deeds, it appears to become a vanishing quantity, because
then the weal of another is advanced at the cost of the benefactor, the
self of another placed on an equality with his own. And when it is a
question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> saving a number of fellow-beings, total self-obliteration
may be developed, the one giving his life for many.</p>

<p>The inquiry now presents itself, whether the latter way of looking at
the relation subsisting between the ego and the non-ego, which forms
the mainspring of a good man's conduct, is mistaken and due to an
illusion; or whether the error does not rather attach to the opposite
view, on which Egoism and Malice are based.</p>

<p>No doubt the theory lying at the root of Egoism is, from the
<b>empirical standpoint</b>, perfectly justified. From the testimony of
experience, the <b>distinction</b> between one's own person and that of
another appears to be absolute. I do not occupy the same space as my
neighbour, and this difference, which separates me from him physically,
separates me also from his weal and woe. But in the first place, it
should be observed that the knowledge we have Of our own selves is by
no means exhaustive and transparent to its depths. By means of the
intuition, which the brain constructs out of the data supplied by the
senses, that is to say, in an indirect manner, we recognise our body as
an object in space; through an inward perception, we are aware of the
continuous series of our desires, of our volitions, which arise through
the agency of external motives; and finally, we come to discern the
manifold movements, now stronger, now weaker, of our will itself, to
which all feelings from within are ultimately traceable. And that is
all: <b>for the perceiving faculty is not in its turn perceived</b>.
On the contrary, the real substratum of our whole phaenomenal nature,
our inmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> essence in itself, that which wills and perceives, is not
accessible to us. We see only the outward side of the ego; its inward
part is veiled in darkness. Consequently, the knowledge we possess
of ourselves is in no sort radical and complete, but rather very
superficial. The larger and more important part of our being remains
unknown, and forms a riddle to speculate about; or, as Kant puts it:
"The ego knows itself only as a phaenomenon; of its real essence,
whatever that may be, it has no knowledge." Now, as regards that side
of the self which falls within our ken, we are, undoubtedly, sharply
distinguished, each from the other; but it does not follow therefrom
that the same is true of the remainder, which, shrouded in impenetrable
obscurity, is yet, in fact, the very substance of which we consist.
There remains at least the possibility that the latter is in all men
uniform and identical.</p>

<p>What is the explanation of all plurality, of all numerical diversity of
existence? Time and Space. Indeed it is only through the latter that
the former is possible: because the concept "many" inevitably connotes
the idea either of succession (time), or of relative position (space).
Now, since a homogeneous plurality is composed of <b>Individuals</b>,
I call Space and Time, as being the conditions of multiplicity, the
<i>principium individuationis</i> (the principle of individuation); and I
do not here pause to consider whether this expression was exactly so
employed by the Schoolmen.</p>

<p>If in the disclosures which Kant's wonderful acumen gave to the world
there is anything true beyond the shadow of a doubt, this is to be
found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> in the Transcendental Aesthetics, that is to say, in his
doctrine of the ideality of Space and Time. On such solid foundations
is the structure built that no one has been able to raise even an
apparent objection. It is Kant's triumph, and belongs to the very small
number of metaphysical theories which may be regarded as really proved,
and as actual conquests in that field of research. It teaches us that
Space and Time are the forms of our own faculty of intuition, to which
they consequently belong, and not to the objects thereby perceived;
and further, that they can in no way be a condition of things in
themselves, but rather attach only to their mode of <b>appearing</b>,
such as is alone possible for us who have a consciousness of the
external world determined by strictly physiological limits. Now, if to
the Thing in itself, that is, to the Reality underlying the kosmos, as
we perceive it, Time and Space are foreign; so also must multiplicity
be. Consequently that which is objectivated in the countless phaenomena
of this world of the senses cannot but be a unity, a single indivisible
entity, manifested in each and all of them. And conversely, the web of
plurality, woven in the loom of Time and Space, is not the Thing in
itself, but only its <b>appearance-form</b>. Externally to the thinking
subject, this appearance-form, as such, has no existence; it is merely
an attribute of our consciousness, bounded, as the latter is, by
manifold conditions, indeed, depending on an organic function.</p>

<p>The view of things as above stated,&mdash;that all plurality is only
apparent, that in the endless series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> of individuals, passing
simultaneously and successively into and out of life, generation
after generation, age after age, there is but one and the same entity
really existing, which is present and identical in all alike;&mdash;this
theory, I say, was of course known long before Kant; indeed, it may be
carried back to the remotest antiquity. It is the alpha and omega of
the oldest book in the world, the sacred <span class="gesperrt">Vedas</span>, whose dogmatic part,
or rather esoteric teaching, is found in the <span class="gesperrt">Upanishads</span>.<a name="FNanchor_2_141" id="FNanchor_2_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_141" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There, in
almost every page this profound doctrine lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> enshrined; with tireless
repetition, in countless adaptations, by many varied parables and
similes it is expounded and inculcated. That such was, moreover, the
fount whence Pythagoras drew his wisdom, cannot be doubted, despite
the scanty knowledge we possess of what he taught. That it formed
practically the central point in the whole philosophy of the Eleatic
School, is likewise a familiar fact. Later on, the New Platonists
were steeped in the same, one of their chief tenets being: <i>διὰ τὴν
ἑνότητα ἀπάντων πάσας ψuχὰς mίαν εἶναι</i>. (All souls are one, because
all things form a unity.) In the ninth century we find it unexpectedly
appearing in Europe. It kindles the spirit of no less a divine than
Johannes Scotus Erigena, who endeavours to clothe it with the forms and
terminology of the Christian religion. Among the Mohammedans we detect
it again in the rapt mysticism of the <span class="gesperrt">Sûfi</span>.<a name="FNanchor_3_142" id="FNanchor_3_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_142" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In the West Giordano
Bruno cannot resist the impulse to utter it aloud; but his reward is a
death of shame and torture. And at the same time we find the Christian
Mystics losing themselves in it, against their own will and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> intention,
whenever and wherever we read of them!<a name="FNanchor_4_143" id="FNanchor_4_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_143" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Spinoza's name is identified
with it. Lastly, in our own days, after Kant had annihilated the old
dogmatism, and the world stood aghast at its smoking ruins, the same
teaching was revived in Schelling's eclectic philosophy. The latter
took all the systems of Plotinus, Spinoza, Kant, and Jacob Boehm,
and mixing them together with the results of modern Natural Science,
speedily served up a dish sufficient to satisfy for the moment the
pressing needs of his contemporaries; and then proceeded to perform a
series of variations on the original theme. The consequence is that
in the learned circles of Germany this line of thought has come to be
generally accepted; indeed even among people of ordinary education,
it is almost universally diffused.<a name="FNanchor_5_144" id="FNanchor_5_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_144" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A solitary exception is formed
by the University philosophers of the present day. They have the hard
task of fighting what is called <b>Pantheism</b>. Being brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
through the stress of battle into great embarrassment and difficulty,
they anxiously catch now at the most pitiful sophisms, now at phrases
of choicest bombast, so only they may patch together some sort of
respectable disguise, wherein to dress up the favourite petticoat
Philosophy, that has duly received official sanction. In a word, the
<i>Ἕν καὶ πᾱν</i><a name="FNanchor_6_145" id="FNanchor_6_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_145" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has been in all ages the laughing-stock of fools, for
the wise a subject of perpetual meditation. Nevertheless, the strict
demonstration of this theory is only to be obtained from the Kantian
teaching, as I have just shown. Kant himself did not carry it out;
after the fashion of clever orators, he only gave the premises, leaving
to his hearers the pleasure of drawing the conclusion.</p>

<p>Now if plurality and difference belong only to the
<b>appearance-form</b>; if there is but one and the same Entity
manifested in all living things: it follows that, when we obliterate
the distinction between the <i>ego</i> and the <i>non-ego</i>, we are not the
sport of an illusion. Rather are we so, when we maintain the reality of
individuation,&mdash;a thing the Hindus call <span class="gesperrt">Mâyâ</span>,<a name="FNanchor_7_146" id="FNanchor_7_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_146" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that is, a deceptive
vision, a phantasma. The former theory we have found to be the actual
source of the phaenomenon of Compassion; indeed Compassion is nothing
but its translation into definite expression. This, therefore, is
what I should regard as the metaphysical foundation of Ethics, and
should describe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> it as the sense which identifies the <b>ego</b> with
the <b>non-ego</b>, so that the individual directly recognises in
another his own self, his true and very being. From this standpoint
the profoundest teaching of theory pushed to its furthest limits may
be shown in the end to harmonise perfectly with the rules of justice
and loving-kindness, as exercised; and conversely, it will be clear
that practical philosophers, that is, the upright, the beneficent,
the magnanimous, do but declare through their acts the same truth as
the man of speculation wins by laborious research, by the loftiest
flights of intellect. Meanwhile moral excellence stands higher than
all theoretical sapience. The latter is at best nothing but a very
unfinished and partial structure, and only by the circuitous path of
reasoning attains the goal which the former reaches in one step. He
who is morally noble, however deficient in mental penetration, reveals
by his conduct the deepest insight, the truest wisdom; and puts to
shame the most accomplished and learned genius, if the latter's acts
betray that his heart is yet a stranger to this great principle,&mdash;the
metaphysical unity of life.</p>

<p>"Individuation is real. The <i>principium individuationis,</i> with the
consequent distinction of individuals, is the order of things in
themselves. Bach living unit is an entity radically different from all
others. In my own self alone I have my true being; everything outside
it belongs to the <b>non-ego</b>, and is foreign to me." This is
the creed to the truth of which flesh and bone bear witness: which is
at the root of all egoism, and which finds its objective expression in
every loveless, unjust, or malicious act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Individuation is merely an appearance, born of Space and Time; the
latter being nothing else than the forms under which the external
world necessarily manifests itself to me, conditioned as they are
by my brain's faculty of perception. Hence also the plurality and
difference of individuals is but a <b>phaenomenon</b>, that is, exists
only as my mental picture. My true inmost being subsists in every
living thing, just as really, as directly as in my own consciousness
it is evidenced only to myself." This is the higher knowledge: for
which there is in Sanskrit the standing formula, <b>tat tvam asi</b>,
"that art thou."<a name="FNanchor_8_147" id="FNanchor_8_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_147" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Out of the depths of human nature it wells up in
the shape of Compassion, and is therefore the source of all genuine,
that is, disinterested virtue, being, so to say, incarnate in every
good deed. It is this which in the last resort is invoked, whenever we
appeal to gentleness, to loving-kindness; whenever we pray for mercy
instead of justice. For such appeal, such prayer is in reality the
effort to remind a fellow-being of the ultimate truth that we are all
one and the same entity. On the other hand, Egoism and its derivatives,
envy, hatred, the spirit of persecution, hardness of heart, revenge,
pleasure at the sight of suffering, and cruelty, all claim support
from the other view of things, and seek their justification in it. The
emotion and joy we experience when we hear of, still more, when we see,
and most of all, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> we ourselves do, a noble act, are at bottom
traceable to the feeling of certainty such a deed gives, that, beyond
all plurality and distinction of individuals, which the <i>principium
individuationis</i>, like a kaleidoscope, shows us in ever-shifting
evanescent forms, there is an underlying unity, not only truly
existing, but actually accessible to us; for lo! in tangible, objective
form, it stands before our sight.</p>

<p>Of these two mental attitudes, according as the one or the other is
adopted, so the <i>ϕιλία</i> (Love) or the <i>νεῑκος</i> (Hatred) of Empedocles
appears between man and man. If any one, who is animated by <i>νεῑκος</i>,
could forcibly break in upon his most detested foe, and compel him to
lay bare the inmost recesses of his heart; to his surprise, he would
find again in the latter his very self. For just as in dreams, all the
persons that appear to us are but the masked images of ourselves; so
in the dream of our waking life, it is our own being which looks on
us from out our neighbours' eyes,&mdash;though this is not equally easy to
discern. Nevertheless, <b>tat tvam asi</b>.</p>

<p>The preponderance of either mode of viewing life not only determines
single acts; it shapes a man's whole nature and temperament. Hence the
radical difference of mental habit between the <b>good</b> character
and the <b>bad</b>. The latter feels everywhere that a thick wall
of partition hedges him off from all others. For him the world is
an <b>absolute non-ego</b>, and his relation to it an essentially
hostile one; consequently, the key-note of his disposition is hatred,
suspicion, envy, and pleasure in seeing distress. The good character,
on the other hand, lives in an external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> world homogeneous with his
own being; the rest of mankind is not in his eyes a non-ego; he
thinks of it rather as "myself once more." He therefore stands on an
essentially amicable footing with every one: he is conscious of being,
in his inmost nature, akin to the whole human race,<a name="FNanchor_9_148" id="FNanchor_9_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_148" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> takes direct
interest in their weal and woe, and confidently assumes in their
case the same interest in him. This is the source of his deep inward
peace, and of that happy, calm, contented manner, which goes out on
those around him, and is as the "presence of a good diffused." Whereas
the bad character in time of trouble has no trust in the help of his
fellow-creatures. If he invokes aid, he does so without confidence:
obtained, he feels no real gratitude for it; because he can hardly
discern therein anything but the effect of others' folly. For he is
simply incapable of recognising his own self in some one else; and
this, even after it has furnished the most incontestible signs of
existence in that other person: on which fact the repulsive nature of
all unthankfulness in reality depends. The moral isolation, which thus
naturally and inevitably encompasses the bad man, is often the cause
of his becoming the victim of despair. The good man, on the contrary,
will appeal to his neighbours for assistance, with an assurance equal
to the consciousness he has of being ready himself to help them. As I
have said: to the one type, humanity is a <b>non-ego</b>; to the other,
"myself once more." The magnanimous character, who forgives his enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and returns good for evil, rises to the sublime, and receives the
highest meed of praise; because he recognises his real self even there
where it is most conspicuously disowned.</p>

<p>Every purely beneficent act all help entirely and genuinely unselfish,
being, as such, exclusively inspired by another's distress, is, in
fact, if we probe the matter to the bottom, a dark enigma, a piece
of mysticism put into practice; inasmuch as it springs out of, and
finds its only true explanation in, the same higher knowledge that
constitutes the essence of whatever is mystical.</p>

<p>For how, otherwise than metaphysically, are we to account for even
the smallest offering of alms made with absolutely no other object
than that of lessening the want which afflicts a fellow-creature? Such
an act is only conceivable, only possible, in so far as the giver
<b>knows</b> that it is his very self which stands before him, clad in
the garments of suffering; in other words, so far as he recognises the
essential part of his own being, under a form not his <b>own</b>.<a name="FNanchor_10_149" id="FNanchor_10_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_149" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
It now becomes apparent, why in the foregoing part I have called
Compassion the great mystery of Ethics.</p>

<p>He, who goes to meet death for his fatherland, has freed himself from
the illusion which limits a man's existence to his own person. Such a
one has broken the fetters of the <i>principium individuationis</i>. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
widened, enlightened nature he embraces all his countrymen, and in them
lives on and on. Nay, he reaches forward to, and merges himself in the
generations yet unborn, for whom he works; and he regards death as a
wink of the eyelids, so momentary that it does not interrupt the sight.</p>

<p>We may here sum up the characteristics of the two human types
above indicated. To the Egoist all other people are uniformly and
intrinsically strangers. In point of fact, he considers nothing
to be truly real, except his own person, and regards the rest of
mankind practically as troops of phantoms, to whom he assigns merely
a relative existence, so far as they may be instruments to serve, or
barriers to obstruct, his purposes; the result being an immeasurable
difference, a vast gulf between <b>his ego</b> on the one side, and the
<b>non-ego</b> on the other. In a word, he lives exclusively centred in
his own individuality, and on his death-day he sees all reality, indeed
the whole world, coming to an end along with himself.<a name="FNanchor_11_150" id="FNanchor_11_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_150" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Whereas the
Altruist discerns in all other persons, nay, in every living thing,
his own entity, and feels therefore that his being is commingled, is
identical with the being of whatever is alive. By death he loses only
a small part of himself. Patting off the narrow limitations of the
individual, he passes into the larger life of all mankind, in whom he
always recognised, and, recognising, loved, his very self; and the
illusion of Time and Space, which separated his consciousness from that
of others, vanishes. These two opposite modes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> of viewing the world are
probably the chief, though not indeed the sole cause of the difference
we find between very good and exceptionally bad men, as to the manner
in which they meet their last hour.</p>

<p>In all ages Truth, poor thing, has been put to shame for being
paradoxical; and yet it is not her fault. She cannot assume the form
of Error seated on his throne of world-wide sovereignty. So then, with
a sigh, she looks up to her tutelary god, Time, who nods assurance
to her of future victory and glory, but whose wings beat the air so
slowly with their mighty strokes, that the individual perishes or ever
the day of triumph be come. Hence I, too, am perfectly aware of the
paradox which this metaphysical explanation of the ultimate ethical
phaenomenon must present to Western minds, accustomed, as they are, to
very different methods of providing Morals with a basis. Nevertheless,
I cannot offer violence to the truth. All that is possible for me to
do, out of consideration for European blindness, is to assert once
more, and demonstrate by actual quotation, that the Metaphysics of
Ethics, which I have here suggested, was thousands of years ago the
fundamental principle of Indian wisdom. And to this wisdom I point
back, as Copernicus did to the Pythagorean cosmic system, which was
suppressed by Aristotle and Ptolemaeus. In the Bhagavadgîtâ (Lectio
XIII.; 27, 28), according to A. W. von Schlegel's translation, we find
the following passage: <i>Eundem in omnibus animantibus consistentem
summum dominum, istis pereuntibus kaud pereuntem qui cernit, is vere
cernit. Eundem vero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> cernens ubique praesentem dominum, non violat
semet ipsum sua ipsius culpa: exinde pergit ad summum iter</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_151" id="FNanchor_12_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_151" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>With these hints towards the elaboration of a metaphysical basis for
Ethics I must close, although an important step still remains to be
taken. The latter would presuppose a further advance in Moral Science
itself; and this can hardly be made, because in the West the highest
aim of Ethics is reached in the theory of justice and virtue. What lies
beyond is unknown, or at any rate ignored. The omission, therefore, is
unavoidable; and the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> need feel no surprise, if the above slight
outline of the Metaphysics of Ethics does not bring into view&mdash;even
remotely&mdash;the corner-stone of the whole metaphysical edifice, nor
reveal the connection of all the parts composing the <i>Divina Commedia</i>.
Such a presentment, moreover, is involved neither in the question set,
nor in my own plan. A man cannot say everything in one day, and should
not answer more than he is asked.</p>

<p>He who tries to promote human knowledge and insight is destined to
always encounter the opposition of his age, which is like the dead
weight of some mass that has to be dragged along: there on the ground
it lies, a huge inert deformity, defying all efforts to quicken
its shape with new life. But such a one must take comfort from the
certainty that, although prejudices beset his path, yet the truth is
with him. And Truth does but wait for her ally, Time, to join her; once
he is at her side, she is perfectly sure of victory, which, if to-day
delayed, will be won <b>to-morrow</b>.</p>

<h4>JUDGMENT OF THE DANISH ROYAL SOCIETY OF SCIENCES.</h4>

<p>In 1837 the following question was set as subject for a Prize Essay:
"Is the fountain and basis of Morals to be sought for in an idea of
morality which lies directly in the consciousness (or conscience), and
in the analysis of the other leading ethical conceptions which arise
from it? Or is it to be found in some other source of knowledge?" There
was only one competitor; but his dissertation, written in German,
and bearing the motto: "<i>To preach Morality is easy, to found it is
difficult</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1_152" id="FNanchor_1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_152" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we cannot adjudge worthy of the Prize. He has omitted
to deal with the essential part of the question, apparently thinking
that he was asked to establish some fundamental principle of Ethics.
Consequently, that part of the treatise, which explains how the moral
basis he proposes is related to his system of metaphysics, we find
relegated to an appendix, as an "<i>opus supererogationis</i>," although
it was precisely the connection between Metaphysics and Ethics that
our question required to be put in the first and foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> place. The
writer attempts to show that compassion is the ultimate source of
morality; but neither does his mode of discussion appear satisfactory
to us, nor has he, in point of fact, succeeded in proving that such a
foundation is adequate. Indeed he himself is obliged to admit that it
is not.<a name="FNanchor_2_153" id="FNanchor_2_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_153" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Lastly, the Society cannot pass over in silence the fact
that he mentions several recent philosophers of the highest standing in
an unseemly manner, such as to justly occasion serions offence.</p>
